A few weeks ago_comma_ I was walking through my hallway_comma_ minding my own business_comma_ when all of a sudden a hand reached out from under a table and grabbed my ankle. I was so suprised. I thought i was got. Turns out_comma_ it was my son. 	0

Thats horrible_comma_ hope he is ok.	0 
yeah_comma_ he had just drank a bottle_comma_ and I was moving him around like an airplane. In retrospect. I deserved it.	0 
I see_comma_ glad he is ok.	1

That was kind of you_comma_ I am sure they appreciated that!	1 
I went to the Kemah boardwalk with my boyfriend. It made me think of times I went vacationing with my family.	0 
My last vacation went horribly wrongQ!	0 
All I thought about was being at home again and being able to relive those moments.	0 
Yes I love to reminice	1 
My dog died a few years ago after I had my son.  It was right around Christmas and I had the dog for fourteen years.	0 
Im sorry to hear that. I have never had a dog. What was your experience of the dog?	0 
The dog was there with my throughout my life. He saw me through boyfriends and friends.	0 
I am really sorry to hear that. What was the dogs name?	1

Hello	0 
Hi_comma_ a few months ago_comma_ my mother found some stray dogs that were starving_comma_ so she told us about them. Of course_comma_ we brought the poor babies to our house_comma_ a mother dog and her two puppies. My heart went out to them_comma_ as their ribs were showing_comma_ but they were still so loving and sweet.	0 
Oh no im so sorry to hear that :/ Thats good that you took them in 	0 
Yes_comma_ I really felt so much sympathy for them and we all really liked them. We already had several pets_comma_ so I wasn't going to keep them_comma_ but I wanted to help them get better and find them a good home. We did for all of them_comma_ with the puppies being able to stay together.	1 
I wanted to let you know recently i saw a younger man helping an old lady who fell to the ground. Its nice to see people helping others	0 
That is really nice to see... I bet it made you feel good! So sweet. 	0 
yeah it made me feel great :)	0 
Nice to still see that behavior in todays world. :)	1 
So this one time my grandmother gave me a scooter_comma_ it was the best gift ever_comma_ I was really happy	0 
Thats sweet that you remember that_comma_ how old were you? 	0 
I was around 10 years old I think_comma_ it was quite a long time ago for me now haha!	0 
I wont make you reveal your age! lol :p 	0 
Hah appreciated_comma_ have you ever received a fun gift?	1 
I was extremely lucky when my girlfriend said she would date me_comma_ she is my world now.	0 
That's wonderful. How long have you guys been dating?	0 
We have been together for close to 5 months now_comma_ so not very long haha!	0 
Time flies by pretty fast. Could be together 10 years from now!	0 
I hope so haha_comma_ are you dating anyone?	1 
I started a new job about a month ago and it's going really well.	0 
congratualtions. what do you do?	0 
I work in I.T. for the provincial government in Canada :)	0 
oh wow. we're practically neighbors.	1 
So my friend built a deck and it turned out amazing_comma_ I didn't know he had it in him.	0 
How big was the deck?	0 
I think its probably about 20 feet by 25 feet? I'm bad at guessing that kind of stuff hah	0 
Wow that is big.	1 
My girlfriends really quiet and she tends to scare me a lot.	0 
What is scary about what she is doing? I'm not quite understanding what you mean.	0 
Well_comma_ when shes dealing with her own personal issues she tends to kind of just vanish_comma_ I haven't talked to her in a few days and it's making me worry.	0 
Oh wow_comma_ I can see why you're worrying. You should really talk to her about all this if she comes around soon.	1 
I have to fill out forms all day so I scripted a program that does half of it for me and it works really well!	0 
Thats great. Did you create the script?	0 
Yeah_comma_ had to google a bit of it but it worked out well.	0 
I love google. It is my favorite search engine.	1 
I was extremely relieved when I found out my dad beat cancer.	0 
Thats wonderful news! Its such a nasty disease! How long has he been clear? 	0 
About 2 years now.	0 
Well I hope he has 100 more years to go! :) 	1 
My girlfriend hasn't talked to me in a few days and I'm struggling to keep it together but I am at the moment.	0 
Have you tried to call her?	0 
I have_comma_ but she's going through a rough time and likes to seclude herself.	0 
Maybe give her space.	1 
My grandma gave me a stone and said it was my birthstone and I hold it very close to my heart now.	0 
What birthstone is it.	0 
It is amethyst.	0 
What birthstone is it?	1 
I play some competitive video games and I think I'm pretty good at one of them.	0 
I love to play Madden.	0 
Do you play Madden often?	0 
Yes_comma_ every day.	1 
I haven't been able to talk to my girlfriend in a few days and it's making me quite sad.	0 
Where is she?	0 
She's in the same city as me_comma_ but she's going through a hard time and has decided to seclude herself so I can't reach her.	0 
Just give her space.	1 
My daughter is very smart. She learns things really quickly.	0 
Thats great.	0 
Yes_comma_ she picks up on things that I didn't even think she knew about.	0 
Did you teach her?	1 
I can't believe how big the waves are. Hurricane Chris amped up my summer.	0 
Did you stay and ride it out? I bet it was quite a thing to see!	0 
Yes_comma_ I've been surfing for ever. Only three of us in the water. 	0 
That must be so much fun. I have never surfed but love to be on a boat. 	0 
You are never to old to start. I'm teaching my mate and he is 70 I think. Hopefully I have a boat soon.'	0 
Wow I hope I am fit enough at 70 to surf!	1 
I usually hate to ask for help_comma_ so when my friends all surprised me by taking turns bringing us meals for 2 weeks after my 4th child was born I was blown away. I was so relieved to have help. 	0 
Wow_comma_ 4 children my first is on the way and I'm freaking out. You must have great friends.  	0 
That is so exciting_comma_ congratulations! We moved 17 hours away from family_comma_ so having a great group of friends is really important to us. 	0 
Thank You. That is our next step we are moving from NYC to Miami after the baby. How can we find friends like yours? 	0 
Get involved in something. Church_comma_ a social club for interests you are in. I don't recommend parent groups_comma_ for some reason they get really nasty. Just find a way to connect with people. Having children is so much harder without a support system!	0 
I see what you mean about a parents group. I joined a dads group in facebook and it's full of people who complain non stop about  being an adult. 	1 
I went to this thing called a Paint Night and I ended up making an okay looking painting	0 
That sounds fun_comma_ I was never any good at painting	0 
I am not either_comma_ but they had an instructor to follow along to! :)	0 
That probably helps a good deal!	1 
That Jerk_comma_ Did'nt even wave when he cut me off. 	0 
I wish I had a rubber bumper to ram those people with!	0 
After the Apocalypse I'll just ran them off the road. To make things worse he was in a Horse and Buggy. 	0 
That is terrible_comma_ he could have hurt the horse!	0 
That's what me the most mad. It's like he did not care at all. 	1 
So I got a new job recently_comma_ and I got my first paycheck and it was pretty good compared to what I was expecting!	0 
Nice_comma_ congratulations. How are you liking the new job itself?	0 
It's pretty good so far_comma_ I think I'm gonna like it for the long haul!	0 
Awesome_comma_ I hope the job goes great for you!	1 
When I was a little girl_comma_ our cat ran away and was gone so long we didn't think he would come home so we adopted another kitten. 	0 
Thats sad_comma_ hopefully the new cat got to live a long and full life with you	0 
Well_comma_ we had a funny twist. The same day we brought the new kitten home_comma_ or old cat showed up. We kind of thought maybe he was hanging out close to home and was mad that we replaced him.	0 
Haha thats crazy_comma_ I hope they became best friends_comma_ I love cats.	1 
I really liked having my mom here. She helped with the kids but then when she left I missed it.	0 
I can imagine! That extra set of hands -- and a person you can *trust* -- that's the best!	0 
Yes_comma_ the kids really missed her when she left. It took us a while to get back to the normal around here.	0 
Does she live far away? It sounds like maybe visits aren't too frequent.	1 
This one time I spent an entire hour waiting for food at dennys.	0 
An hour? Damn for somewhere as meh as Denny's that really isn't worth it.	0 
Its really not_comma_ the foods not worth that long of a wait.	0 
I haven't been there in so long for that exact reason.	1 
I went to a nice work dinner with my husband. I can't get over how stupid I made myself look. 	0 
Oh really? What happened that made you look bad?	0 
I went to the bathroom real fast before we went into the dining room. I tucked my dress into my panty hose and didn't even notice. I walked past everyone with my underwear showing. I'm sure I'll laugh about it... someday. 	0 
Oof yea that seems like it might take a few years or 10 before you can laugh at it but at least its over.	1 
A lady was having issues with a program on her computer_comma_ and I solved it with no problems!	0 
That's awesome! My experience was quite opposite as I sat waiting in the dentist chair for a 2 1/2 hour procedure!	0 
That sounds unpleasant_comma_ did you get in afterwards?	0 
Yes! I'm actually glad it's over :) So_comma_ how long did it take you to fix the computer problem?	1 
I'm so angry they end up charging me 255 in charges that did not belong to me.  	0 
Yeah_comma_ that is pretty annoying to have happen.	0 
I called them and did not hold back. 	0 
Good man! That is your money and they just wanna snatch from you.	0 
I was going to go down and go nuts but my wife stopped me. 	1 
My friend was telling me about teaching jobs to apply for. I didn't get hired_comma_ but she got one right off the bat!	0 
It sounds like you're happy for her_comma_ which is commendable given you didn't get hired. Were you very disappointed?	0 
I was kind of envious that she got the job and I didn't because it seemed like I was more qualified than she was.	0 
That's always tough. It's so hard to tell what other factors come into play in situations like that. Are you happy where you're currently at_comma_ or still looking?	1 
My girlfriend has some mental health issues and sometimes ends up in the hospital_comma_ and I go and see her as often as I can.	0 
I'm so sorry about that. It sounds like you're doing your best to be supportive.	0 
Thanks_comma_ I am definitely trying to be as supportive as I can_comma_ she's my world.	0 
She's very lucky to have you. I wish you guys the best!	1 
I love going to places that I explored and play at as a child. Every time I go_comma_ I always feel super nostalgic.	0 
I am very nostalgic too_comma_ that must be a fun time!	0 
Yes_comma_ until you realize that it was 20 years since you played there_comma_ and you start feeling old	0 
That is true_comma_ but it is part of life_comma_ but it is cool to see things again_comma_ regain perspective	1 
I hope this doesn't make me sound like a horrible boyfriend_comma_ but when my girlfriend first moved into my house_comma_ I felt very apprehensive towards the move at first. I was used to it being one way_comma_ and she was changing everything. Took some getting used to.	0 
I'm sure it did! It's not easy to have to adapt to another person's habits.	0 
I know. It caused some tension the first week or so. I had to take a deep breath_comma_ and realize its just things_comma_ and it was just me being reluctant to change. 	0 
Yes_comma_ sometimes we have to learn to let go of the little things so we can appreciate the more important things. It sounds like you have done a great job!	1 
I always hate thinking that my son is getting old. Just like a few days ago_comma_ I was looking at some of my sons old clothes_comma_ and it made me very sentimental. I never want him to get old on me. 	0 
I believe you are really sad although it's a fact of life	0 
Yes. You get to see them change and grow. It makes it all worth it. 	0 
True_comma_ and the good thing is that when the kids grow_comma_ they provide moral support to parents.	1 
I love a good surprise like anyone else; however_comma_ when my girlfriend waited until 8 pm on my birthday to tell me happy birthday and give me a present_comma_ I was caught off guard. I thought she had forgot. 	0 
Maybe she did and remembered last minute. You should ask her!	0 
She remembered but was trying to draw it out to make me think that she had forgot. I should have known because I made her wait until 10 pm on her birthday.	0 
Next year I would just forget her birthday all together!	1 
I work two full time jobs and he stays at home all day_comma_ Not Fair!	0 
Is he a stay at home father_comma_ or does he just not want to work?	0 
He's 20 he just wants to party and sleep.	0 
I am sorry to hear that. Maybe as he gets older he will get his priorities in order and see how hard you work.	0 
Doubtful_comma_ he's a punk!	1 
So the other day was my 23rd Birthday! I had no idea what my friends had planned but i walked into a room_comma_ a room which i thought was empty as the lights were all off_comma_ and all my friends jumped out and yelled happy birthday! It was such a shock_comma_ and felt so nice to have people who cared deeply about me provide me with such an experience! 	0 
Must of been pretty surprised_comma_ Also great to have friends like that.	0 
It really was! They even had my favorite kind of cake_comma_ chocolate mousse from my favorite bakery! 	0 
That must of just made everything even better!	0 
Right?! I mean who doesn't love cake. But that's not even the best part. on the counter_comma_ there was a HUGE pile of presents calling my name. 	1 
I'm thrilled. I got a raise!	0 
That is a great news. You surely have done a great job.	0 
Best Ever. I didn't have a clue I was going to get it. I just walked in and boom got a raise.	0 
You are very lucky	0 
Your not kidding and to think I was going to quit. 	1 
Have you seen the film "within" on netflix? The other night my boyfriend and i watched it and I had trouble sleeping afterwards_comma_ it was pretty creepy!	0 
No I haven't actually_comma_ I recently just canceled my netflix service! I have been thinking about resubscribing though. 	0 
Why did you cancel your subscription? If you ever re-subscribe i would definetly recommend checking out "within"!	0 
I could not find the content that was best suited for me personally to consider it worthy at the time_comma_ but if I do I will definitely check it out!	1 
I spilt wed wine on my moms red carpet and blamed it on the cat	0 
Was the color of red that different to show on the red carpet?	0 
Very! It was a dark maroon stain. 	0 
Oh! wow that must of been pretty obvious then.	1 
My wife is angry and I don't know what to say. My anniversary was yesterday and I had no clue!	0 
Argh! That's tough! Have you been able to come from a place of authentic apology? It can be easy to be defensive in those situations_comma_ which of course only makes it worse!	0 
I'm still working on it. she has has not given me much of a chance. 	0 
What's your approach? Does humor ever work....? You know_comma_ like wearing a dunce cap while holding a huge bouquet of flowers? Or going John Cusack and holding a boombox overhead_comma_ playing "your" song?	0 
I used diamond earrings. 	1 
So the other night my boyfriend and I were out socializing at a networking event and another woman went up to him and touched his arm I coudn't help but feel a little envious even though he pulled away.	0 
You should not be so insecure like that.	0 
Its not about insecurity! 	0 
What is about them? Do you think he is better than you?	1 
Have you ever been to Las Vegas? 	0 
yes_comma_ several times.The place is magical.	0 
I'm actually going for the first time in my adult life this fall! I'm really excited!	0 
Well_comma_ you are about to have the fun of your life_comma_ but gamble responsible.	1 
I was thinking about my boyfriends wedding proposal the other night_comma_ it had left me in absolute shock. I did not expect him to get down on one knee and propose.	0 
Why. Did you started dating recently or something	0 
No we'd been dating a very long time but he was never the traditional kind. Never wanted an official ceremony but after meeting me i guess it all changed!	0 
The most important thing is what you want.	1 
I'm one of the best surfers that has ever hit the beach. I ride giants.	0 
Really?? are you famous then? What is your name?	0 
Yes_comma_ you can google me.	0 
Are you still competing on a professional level?	0 
Nope_comma_ I've got a family now to support so I surf less and work more. But I've still got killer moves. 	1 
I can't believe the bottom of the bag ripped and my wonderful taco's covered the ground. I'm sure my face was bright red with anger.	0 
NOT THE TACOS!!!! Seriously_comma_ I can understand how frustrating that is. Especially when you have the taste for something.....then gone!	0 
It's not like I could back in. I waited in line 20 minutes and had been looking forward to them all day. I had to skip lunch due to work being busy. I'm still mad.	0 
Even worse. I'm so sorry. What did you do instead?	0 
A bowl of dry cereal. 	0 
Laughing *and* crying for you! Next time!	0 
Text time I'm going to treat those sweet fatty taco's like the baby of Jesus. I get heated up just thinking of it.	0 
I wish I could emoticon this whole thing.....a string of cry-laughing. I wish I could treat you to lunch there!	1 
Have you ever participated in any races_comma_ half or full marathons? 	0 
I have not! I used to run a lot for soccer practices. Have you?	0 
I have not either! My best friend recently recovered from a broken leg and just completed her first full marathon_comma_ it was inspirational!	0 
That's great for her. 	1 
I am not afraid to admit this: I am 32 and afraid of the dark. The other day_comma_ my electricity went out due to a storm. It was dark_comma_ I couldn't find my phone or a light_comma_ so I screamed for my girlfriend to wake up. Am I embarrassed to say that_comma_ not at all_comma_ lol	0 
hahaha thats funny why are you still afraid of the dark?	0 
I am not scared of the dark. I am just scared of the things in the dark. And the ironic thing is_comma_ I don't even believe in the supernatural_comma_ so I am scared of the dark to just be scared of it_comma_ I think. 	0 
OOO so you think something else is hiding in the dark and that's why your scared?	0 
Nope. I am just scared that in case there is the supernatural. It makes sense in my head;however_comma_ when I am saying it out loud_comma_ it doesnt_comma_ lol	1 
Before I applied at Inline I really did some background research on the company and what all they were involved in.	0 
That's probably the best thing to do before you go to work for a place. Were you happy with your results?	0 
I was!  It ended up securing me the job because the company itself is small so the CEO and interviewer were really impressed..	0 
Sometimes it's the extra step someone is willing to do that will make it. Good for you!	0 
Thank you!  I really enjoy this position a lot so I am happy it turned out well.	1 
My husband hangs steel and the last time he had to go work in another state I felt really lost and alone for a bit.	0 
I feel the same way when I'm away from my cat.  Does he have to travel a lot for work?	0 
Sometimes he does.  Lately there hasn't been any local work so he has had to go out of state and its just too far to come back.	0 
Maybe one day if you have the time_comma_ you can pay him a surprise visit.	0 
That is a good idea! I'll have to sneak his work schedule and give it a try.	1 
I made it on time to the bus stop.	0 
That is good. Where you running late	0 
I was running late and so did the bus.	0 
That sucks. I hate when I am running late I always feel behind	1 
So I kind of ate the last piece of pizza that we had and I didn't know Tom wanted it... Feeling kinda bad.	0 
I don't think you should feel bad_comma_ you didn't know!	0 
Yeah but he just seemed so disappointed when he came home for lunch.	0 
I'm sure he will be okay. Maybe you can make it up to him.	0 
I should probably just buy him another pizza soon.	0 
Sounds like a good idea.	1 
I will start off saying I hate the water! I can't stand being in it; however_comma_ that changed last week when I took my son to his first pool. His joy erased all my hatred for water. 	0 
Aw. Children will make us do things we NEVER thought we would (or could) do! 	0 
Yes! I start swimming lessons next week. I have went 32 years without knowing how to swim_comma_ and that one visit changed all that. 	0 
That is SO exciting! Congratulations! You are a fabulous role model for your son.	1 
Oh today I heard one of Nannie's favorite songs on the radio.  It made me really miss our car rides together.  	0 
Oh that's so sweet. My grandmother is a great person too and I'm glad to know her.	0 
She was a lovely lady indeed!  I miss our time together a lot especially when I hear the music she used to listen to.	0 
I think it's great that you have such positive memories of her_comma_ that way she'll always be there in some form.	1 
Do you go visit some place that makes you miss growing up?	0 
Yes_comma_ I love to visit the zoo!  	0 
I recently went back to Michigan and got visit my old town and even the High school I had such great times back then.	0 
What were some of your favorite things to do back in highschool?	0 
I played Football all 4 years_comma_ used to Skateboard in the parking lot and hang out in the auto shop. The good old days.	1 
My mother was always there for me when I was sick_comma_ annoyed and sad	0 
That is wonderful!. It is always nice to have at least one good parent.	0 
Well my dad too but my mum was so much more_comma_ even when I was naughty she was still there.	0 
My mom was pretty awesome too! I'm glad you had a good one as well.	1 
When I was little I got chased by a large dog and now that I'm much older the feeling is still the same. 	0 
That is bad. Are you still afraid a lot?	0 
I am_comma_ everytime I see a dog_comma_ I begin to run the other direction instantly	0 
You need to fight your fear	1 
I actually have no friends_comma_ can you believe that? I'm ok with it though.	0 
wow that's very sad!  I am really sorry!	0 
No_comma_ it's not sad. I really like to be alone_comma_ as i'm an introvert. I need my space.	0 
Well I guess if that is something you enjoy.  I can't say that I have alot of friends.  Mostly my friends are family 	0 
Well in that case_comma_ I have a few friends. Outside of family_comma_ I don't. 	1 
Do you ever find it hard to see at night when it's raining?	0 
Yes I do actually_comma_ I was almost in an accident because of rain at night once. 	0 
That's so scary! I am always on edge in those cases. I hydroplaned really bad last time.	0 
I'm glad you were okay and nothing bad happened. 	0 
Thank you. I've never been in a traffic accident. Thank goodness for that.	1 
I was eating at a restaurant and as I was leaving_comma_ an employee there gave me my phone which I had left behind	0 
Oh that was so nice of them! I bet you were relieved!	0 
I was_comma_ it saved me a lot of problems	0 
I bet_comma_ losing your phone causes all kinds of stress!	1 
I written down my notes on a double sided A4 paper_comma_ now I just have to wait for the exam which will begin in the next 5 minutes.	0 
Okay that's good to know. Hopefully you pass the test and I hope you studied. 	0 
Oh I did_comma_ I have been doing it for weeks!	0 
Very nice man. Let me know your exam results when they're released! 	1 
An employee who had not been working as long as me received a promotion	0 
Oh no! I'll bet that made you feel terrible!	0 
I definitely did not feel appreciated	0 
I can see why not! I'm so sorry that happened to you.	1 
When that happened to me_comma_ even the teacher couldn't stop herself from laughing. 	0 
That is hilarious. I bet.	0 
I was so awkward and quiet in school_comma_ how about yourself?	0 
Oh my just the opposite LOL	0 
So you were outgoing and popular_comma_ huh?	1 
I can't wait to December when my first born arrives into the world. I'm going to make sure they have a great life.	0 
Oh wow! Congratulations! That is wonderful.	0 
Thanks I'm stressed_comma_ excited and hopeful for the future. Do you have kids?	0 
I do not yet but hope to one day. I think you will be a great parent! 	0 
Thank you. We have been trying for a year. 	1 
I was just speaking with my buddy. He is very over wight and somehow finished a marathon last weekend. Impressive!	0 
wow yes it is 	0 
I couldn't believe it. Just the day before we were crushing cheese steaks.	0 
He probably stored that up for his energy for the race	0 
I guess_comma_ I;m sure he eat again after that. He loves food. If he can do it I know I can run one.	1 
My friend stayed awake for 36 hours studying for the MCAT! 	0 
Haha oh wow_comma_ how was that for them	0 
she did well actually_comma_ i was impressed with how well she managed to do despite lack of sleep!	0 
Thats great_comma_ im glad she did well	1 
I was commuting to work and a driver cut me off	0 
I hate it when that happens! were you ok?	0 
I made it out ok_comma_ just so irritating	0 
I always wonder what goes through peoples heads when that happens.	1 
I was busy due to work and visited my family for the first time in awhile	0 
That sounds nice! DId you have fun	0 
It was great_comma_ felt refreshing to be around them	0 
I'm glad you enjoyed yourself_comma_ it is important to make time for family.	1 
I get so annoyed with people who say one thing and do something else. My boss is one of those people. I wish there was just instance that I could be like this is where he annoyed me_comma_ but that isn't the case. It happens every day. 	0 
I'm sorry to hear you're having to deal with that	0 
Yeah_comma_ it can get annoying at times. I just stir clear of him when he is around. 	0 
Sounds like the best thing to do honestly	1 
I have an 8 hour shift in the office today but i can't wait to go home to see my boyfriend! 	0 
you will survive_comma_ and you have something to look forward to	0 
exactly_comma_ it's keeping me going since i'm not feeling to good today!	0 
i hope your work day goes by fast	1 
When I was 12_comma_ I got ran over by a truck. I was with my older cousin and his car messed up. Since he was my hero_comma_ I listened to everything he said_comma_ so when he told me to get the truck rolling and jump in. I listened. however_comma_ my 12 year old legs didn't make it and got trapped under the truck	0 
Oh wow that is so scary.  I can't believe he asked someone so young to do that.	0 
Well_comma_ he was 17 at the time_comma_ so in his defense_comma_ he just was being a "dumb teenager". My parents never let me go with him again after that though. 	0 
I really hope you didn't have any lasting effects from the injury?	1 
I only got a B- on an assignment i worked really hard on recently_comma_ but i'm working even harder now studying to ace the exam! 	0 
Wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you will get an A this time?	0 
 I do actually! 	0 
Congratulations! Studying can be hard_comma_ but sometimes it's about technique rather than time spent. Are you doing anything different this time?	1 
I was inspecting rooms yesterday when I bent down to look under a bed_comma_ I felt the back of my pants tear. The hole was the entire back of my pants. 	0 
Oh no! I'm so sorry! I hate when that happens!	0 
Yes_comma_ I have a staff of 30 and I think each one saw me at some point in the day. I have Khaki's on. I had to tape and staple the hole. 	0 
Ugh! That's the worst! Too bad you couldn't run home and change!	0 
That would have been nice. But home is an hour each way. 	1 
I had to compose myself and pull over to remove the spider. I'm so thankful that I didn't freak out and crash the car.	0 
Oh that sounds so scary!	0 
It was very scary_comma_ i'm terrified of spiders. What are you afraid of?	0 
I hate snakes! They are like little evil creatures.	1 
So as I've gotten older over the last 10 years. I gained 30 pounds. My wife has me on a diet but every night when she goes to bed I have a bowl of ice cream. 	0 
Don't even tlak about diets.I miss the times i was young and could eat all i wanted	0 
yea but those times are behind us. Tonight for dinner was a Kale salad. It was gross but I've gotten a dish or rocky road with my name on it later. I do feel bad for lying to her but I need it.	0 
Ugh.So boring.What wrong with being fat.At least they are all happy.	0 
I think I'm average. I'm 5'11" 190. It could be worse. I still exercise a lot. Perhaps I need to enjoy the ice cream more and try to feel less guilty.  	1 
Did you ever attend college? I just completed my bachelor's degree and I'm feeling really good about my future!	0 
Yes_comma_ I have an Associate's in Nursing.	0 
Wow that's great you must enjoy helping others! 	0 
Yes_comma_ it's been a great career.  How exciting for you to be about yours.  Congratulations!	1 
Have you ever felt sandpaper on your bottom? Because that is what the new recycled toilet paper my wife want's us to use feels like. 	0 
Holy smokes! Let me guess_comma_ better for the environment?	0 
yes but in the end it's still paper and still going to the same place. I dream of the day I can enjoy Angel Soft or Charmin again.	0 
You poor soul! I'm all for saving the planet_comma_ but you have to draw the line somewhere. I hope you get some relief!	0 
I'm going to have to start waiting until I go to work to use the potty.	1 
I scored a 95 on my promotion exam_comma_ I was upset that I missed one question.	0 
But that is an awesome grade!  You should be so proud!!!	0 
Thank you_comma_ I am definitely proud! When was your last exam?	0 
Oh_comma_ it's been years since I've taken an exam!  Perhaps the last one was a para-pro exam to help out in the local schools when my kids were younger - but they didn't even give me the grade - it was a pass/fail type exam (the horror of not knowing the grade though!!)	1 
On the way from work I hit 155 in my VW on the Autobahn. I was well impressed with the car.	0 
I love the Autobahn.	0 
I've been faster in my old Audi but this little car is a 4 cylinder and still super fast.	0 
Yes I use to own an Audio.	0 
Awesome_comma_ it's time to buy another.	1 
Last weekend I did something big. I finished my first 125 mile Iron man race. I'm still pumped.	0 
I have never done that_comma_ good job.	0 
That's it was a bucket list item and the hardest thing I have ever done but now I want to do it again.	0 
You should. When is the next one.	0 
This fall. I'm need to train more. It was a 26 mile running race_comma_ 10 mile swim and the rest on bikes. So much fun!	1 
Last night I was looking at my things I have in a storage locker and found a tub filled with my grandfathers things. The good memories came flooding back.	0 
Oh wow thats cool.	0 
Yes_comma_ he's been gone 10 years but I still think of him daily. It's strange how someone can make such an impact on someone for so long. 	0 
Thats good you still think of him.	0 
Yes_comma_ he was my hero and still is I guess. 	1 
I went to a school for massage therapy_comma_ but I was worried at first that it would be strange to massage people I didn't know. 	0 
Thats cool. Was it hard?	0 
Some of it was. I had to learn the name_comma_ attachment point_comma_ and action of every muscle in the body. There are over 800. 	0 
Wow that is a lot.	1 
I think I get it from my mom. She would never open the door for uninvited guests.	0 
What do you get from your mom?	0 
Being bothered by uninvited guests	0 
I don't like uninvited guests either! So annoying!	0 
Some people think it's ridiculous to have a problem with that_comma_ but I adore my privacy and space.	1 
My first dog was a dalmatian. We adopted her and then went right to a soccer game before I even had time to play with her. 	0 
I love dalmatians.	0 
She was a great dog! That game felt so so long though. I had to watch her sitting with my parents while I played. 	0 
How old was she.	0 
6 weeks when we got her. 	1 
I have a friend who is always complaining. She always has to make it sound like her life is harder than everyone else's. 	0 
Well maybe it is but it could also just be she's spoiled.	0 
I didn't know her when she was young_comma_ so she could be. I think she just likes to be miserable. 	0 
Does she have like some other issues like mentally?	0 
I wouldn't be surprised. 	1 
Have you ever put a pair of shoes on your feet that felt so sweet that made your sole happy?	0 
I have a pair of fuzzy slippers that make me feel pretty cozy and happy in.	0 
yea_comma_ I had that but recently my shoes wore out and they no longer make them. I'm so sad!	0 
That is the worse_comma_ you finally find a brand and fit that perfect and they discontinue making them that is the worst_comma_ happens to me all the time.	0 
Yes_comma_ I was angry and sad.	0 
So did you end up finding a shoe that you could live with and that was close to the ones you had_comma_ or have you been unsuccessful?	0 
nope_comma_ I gave up on shoes all together. 	1 
I was on lunch and my coworker made me laugh. I pee'ed my self. I felt like I wanted to die.	0 
Wow_comma_ did they notice?	0 
yep_comma_ to make it worse I'm the boss. I'm pregnant so I tried to pass it off like the baby was pressing on my bladder. 	0 
They will forget about it soon.	0 
The next day someone had put a diaper in my desk.	1 
Becasue of a certain person who worked at the corner grocery I became uneasy to shop there.	0 
I am so sorry to hear that. What did they do to make you feel uncomfortable going there?	0 
They were a friend and customer of mine in a small business and cheated me out of a large sum of money.	0 
That's the worst! You think you can trust people_comma_ and then they stab you in the back. I don't blame you for not wanting to see them again.	1 
I just found out my new insurance is going to cover my big dental surgery coming up. No more bad jibbers!	0 
That is great. That should be good insurance. Are you generaly happy with it?	0 
Yes_comma_ they are covering $4_comma_500 worth of work. I only have to pay $100 total. I can't wait to have good teeth. 	0 
That is nice. Good luck with the sugery.	0 
Thanks_comma_ I'm a little scared but it will be worth it. Being from the UK bad teeth are in my genes.	1 
I have a solo trip coming up. I'm going to Colorado to climb Mt. Elbert Solo. It's the tallest mountain in the united states.	0 
I love Colorado_comma_ my favorite state.	0 
Yes me two. I used to live in Colorado. I have not been up a mountain that big in years_comma_ I'm getting the belly butterfly's. 	0 
I wish I could live there.	0 
It was a great place to live but very expensive and winter was rough.	1 
Last weekend I was on a date with a wonderful guy but right after dinner I got bad gas.	0 
Did you fart?	0 
It sounded like trumpets were filling the room. He looked like he wanted to puke each and ever time. 	0 
Did they smell?	0 
Have you ever drove past a cow farm or garage dump? Yes_comma_ well those smell better then I did that night. 	1 
We had a hail storm about a month ago. It ruined our roof so we are trying to find a good roofing company to replace it. 	0 
Did anyone get hurt?	0 
No_comma_ thank goodness. Just a lot of car and property damage in the area. 	0 
Thats good_comma_ as long as no one got hurt.	1 
My husband just ran a Marathon. He had no training I was blown away by him. True inspiration! 	0 
No training at all!  Wow_comma_ that's pretty impressive.  How far is a marathon?	0 
26.2 miles. He walks about 10 miles a day at work so that's some training sorta.	0 
That's still pretty impressive.  I bet he was proud of himself also!  Does he plan to do it again and will you maybe do it with him?	0 
He wants to do an Iron Man. 126.2 miles_comma_ running_comma_ biking and swimming.	0 
WOW - he certainly is adventurous and determined.  I bet he will do amazing.	0 
Yes_comma_ I'm well impressed with him. 	1 
I don't like saying this_comma_ and this is the first time I have but a few days ago I drove by my ex-wife and mine house_comma_ and for a few seconds it made me nostalgic. 	0 
Wow you are brave.	0 
Yes_comma_ it was only a fleeting moment but it was there. 	0 
I bet you drove fast.	1 
I'm going skydiving this weekend. I'm afraid of heights and freaking out a little.	0 
Oh my! That sounds exciting for sure! I couldn't do it_comma_ I don't think.	0 
Yea_comma_ until this morning when I called and put down a deposit I did not think I could either.	0 
Have you ever done anything else so frightening?	0 
Yes_comma_ I love doing something crazy and the feeling I get from it. 	0 
I would say that you're an adventurous person. Me_comma_ I'm more laid back and mellow. Kudos to you and have fun!	0 
That's i'm so scared but it will be worth it. You only have one life so don't hold back.	1 
Can you believe that I learned to ride a bike at age 15?	0 
At least you did it. Lance Armstrong did not learn until he was 13.	0 
Really? I didn't know that. Is there anything that you'd say you were a late bloomer for?	0 
Love_comma_ it took me 12 years with the same person to build up the courage to ask her to marry me. 	0 
Well congratulations for taking your time_comma_ look at it that way.	0 
yes not if I can just calm the nerves for this skydiving trip.	0 
Maybe try controlled breathing exercises_comma_ I'm sure you'll be fine and want to do it again.	0 
Hope so. I don't do well with heights.	1 
I had a huge exam that like 25 percent of my grade. I study for 2 weeks for it	0 
Oh_comma_ I bet that was very stressful and difficult. I hope you did well on it?	0 
Yeah because the professor got mad that the book store didn't have the little blue books to write in_comma_ so he canceled it and said whatever our current grade was to bump it up a letter grade	0 
Well_comma_ at least you didn't go down in your grade. But_comma_ it wasn't right to treat the students like that!	1 
As i get older I've fully accepted who I am. I'm not here to impress. It makes life easier when you think like this.	0 
That is good_comma_ how old are you?	0 
33 so not super old or super young. Just happy with who I am.	0 
I am 31 so same generation.	0 
Have you stopped caring yet? About others opinions? 	1 
Got a pizza last night. It gave me food poison. Now I'm stilling here sick and angry.	0 
Oh gosh_comma_ I am sorry. Did you let the pizza place know? 	0 
Yes_comma_ I called and they laughed at me. Told me it was the new pizza buy and that he must have used old cheese or something. 	0 
Wow! In that instance_comma_ I would prefer them to lie to me than to laugh and be like I knowingly fed you bad food. 	0 
Yes_comma_ for the first 12 hours I just had to lay in the bathroom floor in pain.	1 
I had studied for an exam for several days_comma_ so I was confident when I strolled into class because I knew I would ace it	0 
and did you knock it out of the park? 	0 
Uh_comma_ I made a B on it_comma_  so it was a false sense of confidence_comma_ lol	0 
Perhaps be less cocky next time? Either way B's get degree's. 	1 
When my son was 5 years old_comma_ he had to have his tonsils taken out. I thought it would be nothing_comma_ but when they went to take him back_comma_ I got so anxious. 	0 
Was he okay? I've never heard of that going wrong.	0 
Yeah_comma_ he was fine_comma_ but I had read a few horror stories online. I knew I shouldn't_comma_ but I did. 	0 
That's where you went wrong lol. I'm glad he was fine. I would've been scared if it were one of my kids too. Surgery is still surgery.	1 
My neighbors are still doing fireworks every night around midnight. Scares my dogs and they can't sleep through it. 	0 
Oh_comma_ I bet that could be frightening for your dogs. Did you try to complain to them?	0 
We don't know them well_comma_ but if they do it again tonight we probably will. I understand on the 4th and even a couple of days after_comma_ but some people have to get up for work. 	0 
I think they have some leftover fireworks that they don't want to sit on. They should just use them next time.	1 
My dog had bone cancer and we had to put her down. It was a very sad_comma_ but necessary decision. 	0 
it takes a strong and compassionate person to make that kind of decision.	0 
It was very hard_comma_ but she was suffering. Our vet was very helpful and we did ask him if he thought it was too soon. He assured us that it was not. 	0 
She had a happy life. I'm sure she understands.	1 
My mom is here visiting me and my family. It has been a really fun visit. 	0 
Sounds nice. How long has it been since you've seen her?	0 
About seven months. Too long. 	0 
Oh wow. That is a long time. Do you live far apart?	0 
Yes_comma_ about a 17 hour drive. 	1 
We had a really great guest speaker at work today.	0 
That's awesome! What did they talk about?	0 
He was a retired FBI agent who talked about his experiences in the field in the 1970's.	0 
Fascinating! What kind of work do you do?	0 
I'm a role player that trains law enforcement by acting as victims or suspects.	0 
Sounds like it was very exciting!	0 
Yeah he talked about his toughest cases and some funny storties about suspects who incriminated themselves with simple linguistic tricks.	1 
I am a bit Breaking Bad fan and love Better Call Saul. Season 4 starts in August. 	0 
Me too! I also Iike staying home all day.	0 
I wonder what will happen this season. I'm expecting it to be really nail biting. 	0 
I have more time to watch movies and shows on netflix alot. I stay home with my little one year old during the day.	1 
I came home today and someone had eaten my leftovers. I was so irritated!	0 
I hate when that happens!  I look forward to those all day you know!  Did you find out who the culprit was?	0 
Yes_comma_ it was my partner. He owes me big time	0 
I think that calls for a nice steak dinner out - on his dime!	0 
Right! He says i'm greedy anyway_comma_ but that's besides the point!	1 
I got into some serious financial troubles a few years back.	0 
It happens to everyone_comma_ are you out of it now?	0 
yeah but what I did was terrible. I was self employed and I manipulated the system so I received money I was not owed/. My husband helped me out of the jam once I came clean about aht I did.	0 
Oh well_comma_ it was nice to have someone to help you.	1 
Do you like fair rides? I can't take them myself.	0 
I don't like them at all. I've seen too many videos on the internet where people get injured or they break easily	0 
Yes_comma_ I remember in 2007 a teen was decapitated at Six Flags in Atlanta.	0 
Yeah that is terrifying. The smaller country fairs are worse. I bet they have no one really checking up on them except the carney folk.	0 
I just don't think they're safe enough_comma_ many rides at the small carnivals are rickety and wobbly.	0 
yeah_comma_ and the people in charge don't get paid enough to always check up and repair them	0 
I'll just stick to the food and go home. Funnel Cakes and Polish Sausages are my favs.	1 
Two years ago_comma_ I discovered that my now ex-wife was cheating on me with someone she worked with. When I first discovered it_comma_ i was angry and hurt.	0 
I bet you were_comma_ I did that to my husband when I was young. I thought it was the solution to relief from abuse.	0 
I know it was a horrible experience at the time_comma_ now I think its the greatest thing to ever happen to me. Sleeping in different beds for 3 years isn't healthy. It took that to wake me up	0 
I guess that was what you call a temporary situation. Sometimes moving on is required.	1 
I wish I could go back to the 80's for a little while at times. 	0 
Don't you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them	0 
That's nothing but the truth! What's your favorite era?	0 
Don't you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them	0 
Do you have a favorite era?	0 
Probably the mid to late 90s. This is going to be hilarious but my one memory from that era is when I first heard Brittany Spears hit me baby one more time song. It changed my life	1 
Did you graduate high school? It's a lot harder than most people think.	0 
Sure I did! It takes determation to succeed	0 
I didn't think I woudl have to do that much studying. I figured that came later in college. 	0 
So if not by studying _comma_what else?	1 
I hit my toe on the edge of the doorway and it bent backwards. I was furious and crying at the same time!	0 
That must have hurt a lot.Did you go to the hospital? 	0 
No_comma_ I don't have insurance. Just like when I twisted my ankle on the stairs and fell. It took months to heal_comma_ but it healed.	0 
You are very accident prone.You should get an insurance right away.	0 
That's hilarious! I can't afford it right now though. I'll just be more careful.	1 
Sometimes we can get a phone call that shakes us to the core.	0 
That is so true. And sometimes that phone call can be a trip of a life time!	0 
My phone call was my mom telling me my 32 year old had just died of a heart attack while at her house.	0 
Oh my goodness! Once things settle down I will give you the info about our cruise. It will help you relax like it did me!	1 
I can't believe my husband planned this all by himself! My mind is still blown by this!	0 
Sounds so exciting. What did he plan?	0 
We are going to Mexico. I have mixed feelings_comma_ but mostly excited!	0 
When and how? Are you flying or driving? Just because or is it your anniversary?	0 
It's our 10th anniversary. We are making the drive to FL since we live in Georgia. 	1 
Don't you hate when you have to give stuff away and then can't? Well_comma_ that happened to me recently. I was going to give away some of my son's old toys_comma_ but started looking at then and realized that I need to keep them for no other reason than that I was being sentimental 	0 
That's too funny. You know_comma_ I'm the exact same way.. I get so nostalgic with my old things. Can never throw them away!	0 
I know! I am always like I need this notebook that has my 3rd grade handwriting back from the 90s because it will be very useful someday... lol	0 
Yes_comma_ someday... Haha. I love looking back at those kinds of things. It brings back so many good memories. Such a good feeling	1 
I was looking through some of my old pictures a week or so ago_comma_ and saw a picture of my grandmother who passed away a few years ago	0 
I'm sorry to hear that. Were you two very close?	0 
Yes_comma_ we were. I used to spend my summer vacations with her when my parents were out of town_comma_ so it allowed me to get really close with her.	0 
That's sweet_comma_ I had the same experience with my own grandma too. God bless y'all!	1 
I was frozen in fear at the gym Monday_comma_ when a guy started seizing. He got so violent and ran away from paramedics.	0 
Wow_comma_ that must have been challenging for everyone! Was he okay ultimately? Was someone able to help him?	0 
They couldn't capture him_comma_ he jumped the fence by the pool and rolled down a hill. I don't know what happened to him.	0 
That IS frightening! Hopefully nothing you'll have to deal with again!	0 
I hope not! I'm not good with crisis situations at all!	1 
Yes_comma_ I was surprise on how he changed to another talk	0 
What was the initial talk?	0 
I should descript how I could feel when am lonely	0 
So how do you feel when lonely?	0 
Wow_comma_ the situation is always very bad	1 
It is funny how you can be going through life thinking everything is great_comma_ and then one day you find a nude of another dude that isn't you on your wife's computer. Makes for a wonderful day!	0 
Maybe she does not have the hots for you anymore.	0 
It is funny how you can be going through life thinking everything is great_comma_ and then one day you find a nude of another dude that isn't you on your wife's computer. Makes for a wonderful day!	0 
yes_comma_ i understood the first time.	0 
Oh_comma_ sorry_comma_ I meant to say Ex-wife. I am so glad she didn't. The years haven't be kind to her_comma_ so got out just at the right time_comma_ lol	1 
I slipped on a puddle in the mall once. I was so embarrassed that I pretended I was hurt badly.	0 
I know the feeling. Once I fell in high school from a puddle and laughed it off even though I was hurt_comma_	0 
Even animals get embarrassed_comma_ I've seen it in my cats.	0 
Oh really? I haven't seen that in an animal as of yet. That's pretty interesting.	0 
Yes_comma_ my cat fell from the mantle above the fireplace and looked totally embarrassed.	0 
Oh dang_comma_ talk about a fall! If I were your cat I'd be embarrassed too! Lol	1 
One day my girlfriend told me about a guy that works with her and she mentioned how hilarious he was which then made me think of a meme that i read about how funny guys will make you laugh and then all of a sudden you don't have clothes on. It was only for a split second but it happened	0 
That is a hilarious intro_comma_ thank you for that! So were you worried that your girlfriend found someone else humorous? (And you're very insightful + intelligent if you say yes! Though being both of those things_comma_ you have nothing to worry about ;-))	0 
Well_comma_ I most def want to be insightful and intelligent_comma_ so I will say YES. I know I had nothing to worry about_comma_ but it is crazy how in those instances when you least expect it a ridiculous meme shots into your brain and you start playing "Along Came Polly" sceneros in your head. 	0 
These references are perfect. And your girlfriend must enjoy you very much. Mazel tov_comma_ you crazy kids!	1 
Lately_comma_ my two year old boy has been so much into wearing dresses and playing with babie dolls_comma_i don't even want to think of i	0 
Is that good or bad? Why the concern?	0 
I think it is bad	0 
OK why do you think so?	0 
Boys are meant to be playing with car toys not dolls.	1 
It is such a privilege to be able to help someone in any way you can.	0 
Indeed. It makes you feel good when you can help somebody else with their problem	0 
It also makes me feel bad when i'm unable to help.	0 
I think if everybody in the world offered a hand of help to one another_comma_ we would not have much problem	0 
That is so true! There is no reason for there to be a problem with famine in the world.	1 
My math teacher told the class I needed to do better on my next test.	0 
Well you should try to study more and see what happens	0 
I did_comma_ I can't remember_comma_ I either made an A or a B in there.	0 
Well maybe you should talk about getting a tutor or somethinf	1 
Well_comma_ this isn't going to make me sound like the manliest individual ever_comma_ but I think I need to tell it to someone. A few weeks ago_comma_ I was driving home from work. It was late. i was tired. So I wasn't my usual self. I was singing along to some song when all of a sudden I glanced up and saw two eyes looking back at me_comma_ and at the time I didn't know whos eyes they were so I was scared to death. I slammed on my breaks_comma_ in the middle of the road_comma_ jumped out_comma_ and was ready to run... I mean fight whoever was in my back seat. Long story short_comma_ I saw my own reflection in the mirror. 	0 
THAT IS TERRIFYING. Until the end of your story.. then I laughed so hard I cried. But that is so relatable. I've been terrified of my own shadow more than once.	0 
It seems to happen to me at least once a week. If I watch a scary movie or show then it happens at least every other day until I forget about it_comma_ lol	0 
That's hilarious_comma_ But I also feel bad for you. Perhaps there is a way to calm yourself down after you watch a scary movie?	0 
I have gotten better. I don't have to sleep in my parents bed anymore. Granted_comma_ I am 32 now_comma_ lol	0 
Haha hey I would sneak into my parents bed even as a teenager when I was scared_comma_ especially during storms.	1 
Why no response?	0 
I'm supposed to wait for you to start. :) 	0 
Is my response not good enough?	0 
You haven't said anything yet other than asking why I hadn't responded. Sorry I'm a little lost as to what I was supposed to respond to?	0 
Se	1 
It is really hot here most of the year.	0 
Really?  Where do you live at?	0 
Alabama. It's winter for about 2 weeks.	0 
I feel your pain.  I live in Orlando_comma_ Florida.  So Im in the same boat.	1 
Ok I was in Walmart buying a video game when this dud eshows up and immediately questions my selection. Like it's some kind of internet forum!	0 
That is so annoying.Who he thinks he is???	0 
I dunno_comma_ but I just said "That's great_comma_ bro" and left.  Then he follows me to the checkout counter to continue giving me crap about it.	0 
I would be scared of a guy like that.	0

This was several years back. I was single_comma_ but I also like watching The Notebook type of movie_comma_ so i thought it would be okay to go watch The Vow alone. Wrong! Horrible mistake.

Aww... sorry to hear that. I haven't personally seen the show. What hit you the most?	0

Can you believe that my neighbors downstairs allow their dog to relieve itself in the street?	0 
That is not very considerate or respectful_comma_ plus the dog could get hurt if a vehicle were traveling down the street.	0 
That's what i'm afraid of as well! But the dog seems to only want to use it that way. Do you like your neighbors?	0 
I live in the country_comma_ so I do not have neighbors that live close. 	0 
How fortunate_comma_ my grandparents lived in the country. I would always be scared at night thinking of their scary stories. 	0 
I sometimes get freaked out_comma_ but getting freaked out every now and then is better than having to deal with neighbors. 	0 
That's true. You can live in peace.	0 
Yes. Peace is key.	1 
I regret drinking way too much soda. Now my teeth look bad.	0

A co-worker at work needed some money for a drink_comma_ but I didnt have any cash_comma_ so I let them have my debit card to go buy them something	0 
I think I would have just said I didn't have any cash and let that be the end of it.	0 
Not really. The individual kind of seemed shady as well_comma_ but my debit card has a feature that allows me to turn it off	1 
I never expected to fail my final exams_comma_that is a major blow for me.	0 
Sorry! Try harder next time!	0

I hope to get a cool job_comma_ not sure what industry I want to be in_comma_ maybe cars or airplanes.	1 
I caught somebody stealing a package from my front yard on surveillance.	0 
Oh wow! I have heard of that happening to lots of people. Did they get arrested?	0 
Not yet. People these days just don't care. They steal anything they lay their eyes on!	0 
Yes they do. It has gotten really bad around here with car thefts. It's no wonder are car insurance rates are so high.	1 
I just got back from buying a few groceries at the store. 	0 
Oh really? What'd ya get?	0 
Just stuff for dinner. At the checkout_comma_ a guy took my receipt!	0 
Why did he do that?	0 
I am not sure. He was on his phone though.	1 
I studied really hard for my math test last week_comma_ so I knew I would ace it.	0 
Math is a tough subject. Good for you.	0 
I know_comma_ I feel like I can solve math problems that even Einstein couldn't solve.	0 
Being good at math will open lots of opportunities for you. Keep at it.	1 
We have taken many unplanned trips this summer that I didn't have money for. But I was able to pick up more work and pay for them.	0 
How exciting that you were able to do that. I hope it was fun.	0 
It has been a fun summer! I am so tired though.	0 
It's funny how you need a vacation to recover from vacation.	0 
Oh yes! I have so many pictures to go through though!	1 
I had a major project and felt very ready to present it to everyone at the office	0 
How'd it go	0 
It went well_comma_ I think I gained confidence by being so prepared	0 
That's great. Do you present often?	1 
I was walking home late at night and noticed I was being followed	0 
Oh no_comma_ what happened?	0 
I ended up running back to my place	0 
Glad you are safe!	1 
My girlfriend seems to be distant and talking to other guys	0 
Have you talked to her about it?	0 
Not yet_comma_ she's also been texting other guys as well I think	0 
That doesn't sound too good. Has she been like this before?	1 
I finished a team based project with some co-workers	0 
Was it fun? Interesting? Engaging?	0 
Yeah_comma_ it was fun_comma_ and we did so well	0 
Good! Team based projects can be very hit or miss depending on your team so I'm glad it worked out for you	1 
My girlfriend broke up with me	0 
Did she give you a reason?	0 
She fell out of love with me	0 
Sorry to hear that_comma_ i hope you find somebody else in your life.	1 
I left my wallet behind by accident	0 
Sorry to hear that.Did you lose money?	0 
I left in the bathroom and was able to get it back	0 
So_comma_ you never actually lost the wallet.	1 
A friend threw a birthday party for me	0 
That sounds amazing! How did it go?	0 
It was a lot of fun_comma_ I had no idea he was planning it	0 
That's amazing_comma_ I have only had one brithday party like that in my life.	1 
I found some old toys of mine	0 
What kind?	0 
Some action figures I had when I was younger_comma_ I felt pretty nostalgic	0 
I use to have a G.I Joe.	1 
A friend of mine was sick	0 
What were they sick from?	0 
Flu_comma_ I went over and gave him some food and medicine	0 
That was nice of you.	1 
A friend who I hadn't seen in awhile showed up at my door	0 
I'll bet you were surprised. Were you glad to see them?	0 
I was very happy to see him_comma_ we ended up going out for drinks	0 
Did you reconnect and promise to keep in touch?	1 
I met a girl I hadn't seen in some tme	0 
Was she your girlfriend?	0 
No_comma_ but we did end up going out on a date	0 
That is great_comma_ did you have fun?	1 
I really hated it when my dog got into the trash. It spilled everywhere.	0 
Yeah_comma_ thats rough. I hate having to clean up mess that wasn't my fault.	0 
Yeah_comma_ it was pretty gross. A lot of rotten food.	0 
Yeah_comma_ that sounds annoying. Maybe try to scold the dog so they won't do it again?	0 
I did. He is just a puppy_comma_ so hopefully he will grow out of it.	1 
I really miss my dog. We had to put her down.	0 
That sucks. What was his name?	0 
Barney. He was such a good boy.	0 
Barney was the name of my hamster.	1 
I was very anxious to start driving at 16.	0 
I know that feeling. It's nerve racking trying to incorporate everything you learned at the DMV in real time.	0 
It really is. It's like I can't remember all the rules of the road.	0 
It's also scary thinking about getting in a car accident the whole time_comma_ that would definitely get me nervous.	1 
I cannot wait to see Taylor Swift in concert!	0 
My wife_comma_ LOVES taylor swift. 	0 
I actually went to high school with her. I cannot believe she is as famous as she is.	0 
That is awesome_comma_ I went to high school with Brett Favre! Small world.	1 
A female coworker came onto me at work the other day_comma_ but I refused her advances because I love my wife.	0 
I am glad you love her_comma_ it must be a nice feeling	0 
Yes_comma_ I just can't see myself being with another woman.	0 
That is a good thing then	1 
I cant believe I got arrested for a DUI this weekend_comma_ I let myself down.	0 
That wasn't smart.	0 
I know I promised myself I wasn't going to drink anymore.	0 
Why did you then?	1 
I feel good about my last semester. I think I'll do better in my engineering classes this fall.	0 
Dang.. my old roommate was an engineering student. He always told me how hard it was. What kind of engineering?	0 
I'm doing mechanical_comma_ it's pretty hard but it's interesting. A career in the field would be awesome!	0 
Yeah_comma_ I think once you get in the field_comma_ you're set. The jobs seem to pay well. Good luck with that_comma_ you sound like you know what you're doing.	0 
Thanks_comma_ I hope I can keep it up_comma_ good luck to you as well!	1 
I hate taking the but_comma_ today I was late to my stop and got there just as it drove away....	0 
Oh_comma_ the bus? Yeah I bet that was a little embarrassing. Sorry to hear that. I take my car for granted. Maybe you will get one someday.	0 
I drove my parents' old car for a little_comma_ and i definitely took that for granted until it broke down lol. I'm trying to save up_comma_ I hope I get one too.	0 
Well_comma_ keep working at it. It's a process. 	0 
Absolutely. I also enjoy biking around sometimes because its green and gets you some exercise.	1 
I can't wait until I see my golden retriever Blue this weekend!	0 
Where has he been?	0 
I live away from my parents_comma_ he lives with them.	0 
Oh I bet you are excited then! He will be happy too!	0 
Yup goldens are happy about pretty much anything lol :) Do you have any pets?	1 
I saw a colleague stealing money at work. I wonder if I did the right thing by not telling my boss.	0 
Is there a reason why you didn't tell your boss?	0 
I just didn't want to be labeled as a snitch_comma_ but now I'm having second thoughts.	0 
Is there a way you could report it anonymously?	1 
I hate when it rains_comma_ especially for several days at a time.	0 
Oh I do too! I like a nice sunny day.	0 
How has the weather been where you are.	0 
It's been really rainy. My power just went out awhile ago.	0 
Oh no_comma_ does that happen a lot when it rains near you?	0 
Yes it makes me pretty upset to be honest.	0 
Hopefully it doesn't rain this week but the forecast is at least 60% all week!	1 
I remember when we used to compete with Yo-Yo's to see who could do the best tricks.	0 
My brother used to have a yo-yo! He did a trick called "Around the world" and also one called "The cradle." Know those?	0 
Yes_comma_ my favorite was called "Walk the dog".	0 
Oh yeah! I remember that! I wasn't good at doing any of them. I mostly just watched him. Good memories.	1 
Last week we were at an amusement park and I cant believe my little brother got on the roller coaster with us. He's usually afraid of heights.	0 
Oh man I would have terrified I hate being up so high. He sounds really brave!	0 
I know_comma_ he usually never goes on dangerous rides.	0 
Did he go on anymore after that?	1 
My son got spaghetti all over himself at dinner at a restaurant one night.	0 
Well he's young_comma_ so you can't really fault him.	0 
I didn't really care too much. I had remembered to pack him an extra set of clothes though.	0 
That's good. You seem like a great parent.	1 
I hate when it is storming it makes me so uncomfortable. 	0 
does it happen often in your part of the country?	0 
Yes especially in the summer time storms are bad and hurricanes are at a high I hide under my covers lol.	0 
wow.  i can only imagine	1 
I was using the toilet at Walmart yesterday and somebody walked in on me.	0 
Thats nuts.	0 
Whats worse is that I was in the wrong restroom. It was the girls restroom. I just wanted to get out of there as fast as I could.	0 
Did she scream?	1 
I was finally going to get to see dolphins up close.	0 
Did you get to? What happened?	0 
I went to Sea World for the very first time. We got to feed the dolphins.	0 
I have never been there! Sounds fun_comma_ but I don't support Sea World and the way they treat their animals.	1 
Last week there was a huge tarantula on my wall. I thought it was going to jump on me.	0 
OH GOSH! I would burn the whole house down. i'm terrified of spiders and bugs	0 
OMG me too! I hit it with a rolled up news paper and a bunch of baby spiders came out. I had a panic attack and stomped on them.	0 
i would have a heart attack!	1 
I will never forget the first time I felt old. I saw a video of grandparents playing with grandchildren and I realized it had been awhile since I did those things.	0 
I know how you feel. Life is too short.	0 
yes_comma_ I try to remind myself that I still have a lot to offer.	0 
Yes_comma_ you do! Just keep living everyday like your last.	1 
Yesterday we had a pool party. My brother got drunk and did a back flip off the roof and landed in the pool.	0 
wow_comma_ I never did understand why people want to get drunk in the first place. I sure hope he wasn't hurt.	0 
I wasn't mad at him. I just never knew he was that athletic.	0 
it does sound like an amzing feat	1 
I got on social media yesterday and saw that my friends went to a party_comma_ but they didn't invite me.	0 
ohh that's rough...did you talk to them about it	0 
No_comma_ sometimes I feel like they just don't understand me.	0 
do they give you any kind of value...or do they just ignore you / put you down 90% of the time?	1 
Awhile back I was taking a relative to get a heart cath. The surgeon sent for me to enter the operating room.	0 
Is your relative okay now?	0 
oh yes_comma_ thank you for asking. other family members just got a call and told them everything went ok. Kind of scary when I was sent for.	0 
It must've have been. Glad they are okay now.	1 
I got teary eyed when I watched my little brother get his diploma at graduation.	0 
Congratulations to him! You must be proud.	0 
I am_comma_ every time he succeeds_comma_ I succeed. I love my big headed brother.	0 
He's very lucky to have you.	1 
I was supposed to drive a friend to work	0 
oh yeah what happened? 	0 
I forgot to pick him up as I overslept	0 
omg is he upset? 	1 
A friend needed help moving	0 
So did you help him / her	0 
Yeah_comma_ he didn't know of anyone else to turn to for help so I gave him a hand	0 
That's pretty nice of you	1 
Yesterday my friend bought the Ferrari I always wanted. I deserve it more than him.	0 
Wow_comma_ thats a nice car	0 
Yes_comma_ I don't know how a clown like him ended up with one before I did.	0 
It happens sometimes I guess	1 
I was thinking about my old neighborhood	0 
Memories.. what state? 	0 
Can't say_comma_ but I was mostly just thinking about the friends I had there growing up	0 
I understand but memories are always nice. 	1 
I needed to use my car to drive somewhere_comma_ but couldn't	0 
What happened with your car then?	0 
My car was hit while parked	0 
Ugh! that stinks! Did you found out who did it?	1 
I was at a Journey concert with my son and he had to go to the bathroom while they were switching out performers. 	0 
I would love that show	0 
It was a very good show_comma_ but the people were so rude. We had to squeeze through a crazy crowd and didn't make it to the bathroom in time.	0 
Oh well_comma_ it happens	1 
i am suffering from severe fever for the past two days i don't have any energy 	0 
Have you been to the doctor?	0 
yes i had. he prescribed medicine for curing 	0 
You will be fine then	0 
i will take care of my self. thank you so much for your concern. take care of you too.	1 
Sometimes I'm surprised my son is actually my son. He currently has enough merit aid to pay for 2/3 of his college tuition!	0 
Well that is quite the accomplishment. 	0 
It is certainly much better than I was ever able to do.  I think my scholarship was $500 and I had no merit aide.  He set his academic bar high... I just told him to do his best.	0 
He sounds like he has a great head on his shoulder. You must have taught him well.	1 
I now have a new boss_comma_ and today was my first day of a leadership meeting with him.  You never know how you will be received.	0 
Oh man_comma_ that's so nerve-wracking. Do you think you guys will be a good fit?	0 
He spent some time laying out his beliefs and his expectations_comma_ and I have to say_comma_ I agreed with all but one of them.  That's pretty good.  He spent a lot of time watching the rest of us interact with each other_comma_ so I think he is trying to feel us out without making judgments yet.	0 
Then it sounds like at least he has some perspective and ability to know not to overreact. I guess you could say you lucked out_comma_ but that may be me speaking too prematurely	1 
My mother will be 85 in a few days. My sister planned a surprise party knowing the day_comma_ hour and location would be very difficult for me to attend.	0 
I hope you make it. Thats a big birthday.	0 
It is day after tomorrow and I am still not certain I can work it out. Sometimes people are very inconsiderate.	0 
That not good. Maybe she will understand if you just can't make it.	1 
My cousin just called with the craziest story. She and her family are locked inside a cemetery.	0 
Wow... That would be one of my worst fears. How did they even manage to do that?	0 
They had gone to a fair and decided to stop on their way home and walk around. I guess her husband lost track of time. The worst thing is they haven't eaten anything since about noon.	0 
Wow! Any way they can get out? Did they call someone?	1 
You hope your teens make the right choices_comma_ but sometimes even the right choices feel wrong.  He is choosing to be away with friends and not at home much.  I believe this is healthy_comma_ but I can help but want something different.	0 
I know it is hard to start letting go_comma_ but it gets easier with time.  Don't worry_comma_ you are not alone.	0 
That's what my own mother says.  In fact_comma_ she said my dad had a harder time than she did when I called and said_comma_ "Hey_comma_ I'm staying the night at so and so's_comma_ be back tomorrow."  I guess I will survive!  Hopefully he will choose to spend time here as he hits his 20s!	0 
Yeah_comma_ they always seem to come back!  You just have to love them from afar for  a while.	1 
I witness a great sight. I saw a gas station attendant leave his post to pump gas for a lady who has a hard time getting around.	0 
That's really sweet. We don't have gas station attendants here. But that's nice that they're that helpful.	0 
The one I refer to is more like a cashier. He is supposed to stay in a little shack and collect money and turn the pumps on. The lady offered him a tip and he wouldn't take it.	0 
Ohh_comma_ that makes sense. Yeah_comma_ then that's really nice of them! And really sweet of her to offer a tip. I guess there's good in the world after all.	1 
I have been fortunate to live a good life but I found a lump in my neck.  Most people would get it checked out immediately.  I waited.  I was scared to get the news.	0 
I would absolutely be scared too. Good news or bad_comma_ I would be a worried wreck beforehand. Have you gotten it checked out yet?	0 
I finally went to an ENT doctor in May.  They biopsied it_comma_ and that was the most nerve-wracking five days I have ever waited.  It WAS good news_comma_ but still had to have removed.	0 
I'm so glad to hear it was good news_comma_ though!	1 
Even when life is tough and seems very unfair I have done my best to care for my family.	0 
Thats great of you. Life is VERY unfair but we can go at any minute_comma_ so cherish those you love!	0 
It can be difficult. But I learned early on retaliating helps nothing.	0 
It doesn't help us no. But you must take care of yourself too- Take some time for yourself when being a caregiver ok!	1 
I am off work for a month in the summer_comma_ but I today was my first day back_comma_ and it felt great to be back on a routine!	0 
Coming back to work could be good after a break.	0 
A month is a great break to "get away from the daily grind" but believe me_comma_ at the end of week one you think oh_comma_ I have all the time in the world_comma_ and you aren't as productive.	0 
I understand	1 
I still can't believe I did that. My power had been off and I didn't even realize it.	0 
That isn't good.	0 
I arrived at church just as everyone was leaving. Boy did I feel awkward	0 
Did anyone help you?	1 
When I was pregnant_comma_ I thought so much about what my son would make me feel!	0 
I wish I could feel that feeling_comma_ (unfortunately_comma_ I am a man). What did you end up naming your son?	0 
I named him George_comma_ men can have feelings of their sons too. Hopefully one day you will as well.	0 
I am greatly looking towards starting a family with my wife as well. George is such a nice name.	0 
Thank you! My husband was excited when I was pregnant_comma_ but I don't think he got it until he arrived.	1 
Have you ever been hospitalized? It's not much fun. I had a mini stroke and was stuck there for a few days.	0 
I have - but not for anything that severe. Are you suffering any side effects of the stroke?	0 
I am 99% me  The hardest part of the hospitalization was at the end of the day when my last visitor would go home. I am not good at being alone.	0 
Yup - I know that feeling. And it's always so hard falling asleep in those uncomfortable beds with an IV in your arm.	1 
I have a full time job that doesn't pay anything.	0 
That really sucks man. Are you planning on looking for a new one?	0 
I love my job_comma_ it involves my five year old kid and my eighty year old grandma.	0 
Well_comma_ as long as you're doing something you enjoy_comma_ that's all that really matters.	0 
It does! I love being there with my family.	1 
I have a table that is somewhat unsteady_comma_ I put my computer on there because I have no where else to put it. 	0 
Have you figured out what's the problem?	0 
I have not_comma_ it seems to do ok except when my son puts his foot on there even though I tell him repeatedly not to do that!	0 
Sounds like maybe one of the legs on the table is bent? 	0 
It could be_comma_ I just hate when he doesn't listen!	1 
My 2 year old daughter keeps picking up random words lately.	0 
Yes? thats so cute_comma_ but you have to be carefull not to say bad words in fron of them	0 
I know!  She said the f word!	0 
OMG_comma_ well it is a bad thing but now you can be more polite in front of them_comma_ and also when you are not with them!	1 
I went to a concert last weekend and saved the tickets.	0 
Are you keeping it as a souvenir?	0 
I am_comma_ I plan to scrapbook it once I get the pictures back.	0 
Nice_comma_ I do that sometimes with movie tickets if it's a great movie that I enjoed a lot.	1 
We recently went camping.  Everyone definitely gets closer in such close quarters!	0 
I've been camping a few times - the proximity to others makes me feel stuffy too. Where do you usually go?	0 
We went by a lake.  I accidentally opened the bathroom door with someone in it!	0 
Oh wow! I bet the person inside would've pooped his pants_comma_ but there was probably none left!	1 
This Spring has really made me appreciate family.	0 
What happened?? Did you guys went camping or something?	0 
My grandmother fell ill_comma_ and passed away.	0 
Ho_comma_ I am sorry to hear that.	1 
I got a notification on my phone that I had a package delivered and went to look for it	0 
Too late I already took it. Just kidding_comma_ did you find it?	0 
I did_comma_ they left it sitting in the middle of the driveway so it could get run over!	0 
Oh_comma_ that's bad. Was there anything important in it?	0 
It was some pills for my dog_comma_ luckily I found it before it got run over. 	1 
My son and wife are coming for a visit. Been a long time since I have seen them	0 
Wao thats so cool you must so excited_comma_ how long has it been?	0 
about a year. I am on the east coast and they moved out west	0 
Wao it must be very difficult to be separated from your wife and son_comma_ sorry	1 
I went to a hockey game with my five year old son earlier this year. I had to bring lots of supplies!	0 
Oh yeah? Do you have to do that every game?	0 
When I have my son with us I do! My husband was shocked when he said he wanted his blanket and I pulled one out of my purse!	0 
Thats funny. Well at least it sounds like you are always prepared. 	1 
I have been married for ten years. Since we aren't swingers_comma_ I'm a one man kinda lady.	0 
That's cool. I am not a swinger either.	0 
Staying with the same guy day in and day out over a long period of time can be tough.	0 
How did you do it?	0 
It's a commitment to stay with just one person.	1 
After a full year of trying to get a leak fixed_comma_ I got help from a neighbor's roofer_comma_ who "knew a guy."  He said the guy didn't work on roofs_comma_ so I was confused!	0 
That makes no sense.	0 
Exactly!  The roofer told me that since I replaced my roof and the leak was still there_comma_ the problem had to be my fireplace chimney.  He said stone chimneys often develop leaks.  As it turns out_comma_ this chimney guy fabricates a type of gutter for chimneys to keep the water from running down the rock.  For $300 he made and installed the "gutter" on site_comma_ and I have had NO leaks!	0 
That seems like a good price.	1 
its so hot here. i've had to shower like 3-4 times a day cause you start sweating anyway and it feels icky. Hows the temperature at your place?	0 
right now it's freezing in my home lol I just got out of bed after 30 mins of sitting because it's coold	0

Oops. I meant I was upset when my dog died.	0 
I'm sorry_comma_ How long has it been?	0 
Happened in Febuary.	0 
That's always a tragedy.	0 
Yea she was 12 yaers old_comma_ and had cataracts_comma_ so I knew it would happen someday	1 
Last week_comma_ my girlfriend invited me to meet her parents. The whole time I was on edge because I wanted to make a good impression.	0 
That's nerve wracking for sure.  How did it go?	0 
Well we had dinner and the whole time a was stuttering because her father was asking very personal questions_comma_ but I think they liked me.	0 
It probably went well_comma_ despite the common jokes most parents want their child to date someone good so try to look for the best in people.	1 
We love going on our annual family camping trip_comma_ and just got back from it!	0 
Oh nice! How long did you guys stay?	0 
We went for a week_comma_ but did have to come back to town once.	0 
Oh no_comma_ What happened?	0 
Nothing bad.  We actually purchased a house to pick up and move_comma_ and they drove it down the road the week that we were on vacation.	1 
I really love being in the great outdoors with my family!	0 
Oh yea? Where are you guys? In the mountains? Camping?	0 
We went camping_comma_ yes.  We're in the Midwest_comma_ so no mountains_comma_ unfortunately.  But we were near a lake.	0 
Lakes are awesome. A body of water around here is pretty far. How long are you guys staying?	0 
We were out there for a week.	1 
I did well on a project for a company	0 
Did you get anything extra_comma_ like a bonus or a trip.	0 
I think I might get promoted based on the work	0 
Great. What business is it?	1 
I was on my way home when a car drove through a huge puddle near the sidewalk	0 
I can tell where this is going.	0 
I got completely drenched_comma_ it was terrible	0 
That has never happened to me. Thank god!	1 
I am a stay at home mom. School just started.	0 
Well does that make you anxious?	0 
It does_comma_ this is my only child and he is going to kindergarten.	0 
Oh_comma_ that would be rough. I've been through that too.	0 
How did you make it through?	1 
A close friend of mine has to leave the state for work	0 
Are you happy for him?	0 
Kind of_comma_ it's going to be sad since I won't see him again most likely	0 
But if is a great opportunity for him_comma_ you should be happy.	1 
A friend was able to fix a problem I was having	0 
That's very nice of the friend. What sort of problem was it?	0 
Computer problem.  It was something I couldn't figure out on my own	0 
Bah_comma_ those newfangled computers. It's nice to have a tech saavy friend.	1 
My coworkers sometimes put more work on me than necessary.	0 
Why do you think they do that?	0 
They don't want to talk on the phone and can get away with it for a while.	0 
That's not fair and probably very frustrating for you. You need to say something to them.	0 
I agree_comma_ I'm actually up for a new position so if that happens they'll actually have to do work for a change.	1 
I moved to tornado alley a few years ago. I'm not used to large tornadoes so I was pretty scared when it started storming.	0 
Oh man_comma_ I can't even imagine. I lived in Kansas for a while and we had a storm that did a lot of damage. Took out the power all day and stuff. Nature can be so devastating sometimes.	0 
We aren't too far south of Kansas in Oklahoma. We have had to spend a few evenings in the storm shelter. I guess stuff can be replaced. 	0 
Jeeeze_comma_ yea_comma_ it's totally understandable to be afraid. Has it been good there otherwise?	0 
I love it here_comma_ except for the tornadoes and snakes. 	0 
It's awesome to hear that! I guess no place can ever be perfect though. Here's hoping we both can live long_comma_ happy_comma_ and fulfilling lives!	1 
I can't believe I spent 2 hours in the car just to arrive to surf and no waves to be seen. 	0

You guess is as good as mine. She's crazy. Today she was stressed. Mind you she is 22 lives at home and has no bills.	0

That had to be relief. So now you won't have to deal with that frustration again.	0 
Yes indeed_comma_ it was frustrating!  I didn't have time to mess with it everytime i had to print something.	0

My neighbor is the worst! He has a dog that he just keeps chained up in the backyard_comma_ and he rarely feeds it. Last week I saw it and he looks anorexic.	0 
That's terrible.  Someone should call animal control on them.	0

that is literally the worst_comma_ the people should have atleast told you to go ahead  first! 	0

I have heard about that game.  I heard there was one guy that makes about $500_comma_000 a month playing it on the streaming service Twitch.  Maybe your son should give it a try.	0 
I have never heard of Twitch.  That is a lot of money_comma_ I could retire!	0 
Twitch is just a place where people stream themselves playing video games.  I guess a lot of people really love watching good players.  Go ahead and retire now and get him started!	1 
My friend got a promotion and moved to California last week. I always thought I would be the first one to get out of this dump.	0

What was she referring to then?	0 
She was talking about the rain storms that hit earlier in the week_comma_ and asked if we were effected by them. 	0 
I see.  Do you get a lot of storms in your location?	0 
Not too much_comma_ but when she asked I said we did_comma_ but we were talking about two different things.	0 
I always hate that when you are never on the right wavelength with someone during a conversation	1

I know_comma_ but since it was my first time I didn't know how to act. My mind started to go blank and I started to sweat profusely. 	0 
I understand completely. It's that initial anxiety. It's a scary thing to do!	1

Oh wow_comma_ that sounds like it might be cool but I don't know what that looks like_comma_ what is the 900?	0 
It's when you turn a skateboard 900 degrees while spinning in the air. It's very hard to do_comma_ so you can imagine the look on my face when I saw my brother do it.	0 
Yea_comma_ how old is your brother?	1

I've ALWAYS wanted to go on a Disney cruise - it's probably my dream vacation. I'm so jealous!!!	1

That's such a great accomplishment and such a relief at the same time. What was your major?	0 
Communications. It was a little tough but not engineering tough!	0 
I totally get that. I majored in business but sometimes I wish I majored in engineering. I'm kind of glad I didn't though. It's hard!	1 
My family is so supportive. They even flew out when my last dog passed away and spent some time with me to make me feel better. 	0 
Aww_comma_ that is very nice of them. i just had to put mine down a few weeks ago.	0 
I'm so sorry to hear that. What kind of breed was your dog? 	0 
Border Collie. Yours?	0 
Yorkshire Terrier. She was a sweetheart.	1 
I was very scared when flying for the first time	0 
I can imagine! Did you end up having a good flight?	0 
I did. Luckily no turbulance!	0 
That's good! Hopefully you had a nice seatmate too!	1 
My son starts school soon_comma_ we had a fun day out but when we got home he was really bad.	0 
Aww_comma_ was he scared?	0 
I don't think so_comma_ I think he was just over the day and it was too much for him.	0 
I can see that. School is a challenging time for a kid.	0 
I have heard that. Just bummed me out for the day.	1 
I was very ready going into my test	0 
Always good to feel ready for something like that. What subject was it in?	0 
Engingeering. It was really tough!	0 
Man_comma_ I remember those days. My engineering exams were killer. Did you do well on it?	1 
Anytime we take a trip_comma_ I normally save what some people consider trash.	0 
Another man's trash is another man's treasure! What things do you save?	0 
Just different things that I can scrapbook_comma_ mementos from my trip. 	0 
I keep a scrapbook myself! I love collecting stamps. Got any trips planned this year?	1 
My pants feel down when riding my bike	0

I just pulled them up. it was just embarassing.	0 
I hope no one saw that_comma_ it must've been terrible.	1 
I was scared to go to school	0 
How are you going to learn! Why are you afraid to go?	0 
Just nervous about all the people	0 
It ain't so bad. I'm sure you'll make a few new friends and everything will be just fine.	1 
I was scared of going into the caves	0 
Please describe what scared you about the caves.	0 
Just the darkness.	0 
That seems like a valid reason to be scared of going into the caves!	1 
We live in a very high cost of living area but don't make a ton of money. 	0 
Is there anyway you can move to somewhere more affordable?	0 
I'm not sure_comma_ sometimes I wish I had what the other people around me had.	0 
I do too but it's natural to get envious of others sometimes_comma_ don't put yourself down over it.	1 
Sometimes people ask me to do a lot of other stuff when I already have a lot on my plate.	0 
That must be so annoying. I get that sometimes too.	0 
I feel like people don't care that I have stuff to do.	0 
I'm sad to hear that_comma_ I'm sure there is someone who cars.	1 
My son went to the best preschool. When I needed him to stay late_comma_ they always had space for him. 	0 
That's good to hear that you care for your son so much. I am sure he will be quite an intelligent child going to the best of the best.	0 
I hope so_comma_ it really helps to get your village when you have kids.	0 
Yeah_comma_ my village helped with my son's preschool tuition as well. Strength in numbers and good neighbors!	1 
I was so grossed out when I saw someone vomit	0

At Fazolis. It was so gross.	0 
During dinner? ACK!	1

i agree it was very sad. i dont know what they will do with the new films	1 
My husband went to go hang out with his guy friends leaving me all alone.	0 
That would make me sad_comma_ did you let him go? 	0 
Yeah_comma_ I mean I didn't want to tell him he couldn't. I just don't like being by myself.	0 
I know how you feel_comma_ I'm sorry about that_comma_ at least he probably came back pretty quickly.	1 
I felt upset when I forgot to ask my friend to dinner.	0 
I'm sure they will understand. You can always have another dinner_comma_ that's the beauty of life!	0 
That is true. Good way to look at things!	0 
Where did you end up going?	1 
Tomorrow's my last day of work. I can't believe it. I wish I had something lined up. 	0 
Oh no_comma_ have you look at other options?	0 
I have and tried negotiating with my old work. I have an interview next week with another company so I hope that goes well!	0 
I really hope you get it!	1 
I was so mad when some guy cut me off in traffic!	0 
Oh no. Did you flip him off?	0 
No_comma_ I remained calm_comma_ but I was very mad!	0 
That was probably for the best anyway. People who drive like that are the worst_comma_ though.	1 
i couldnt stand it when my neighbor was using power tools at 8 am on a saturday	0 
Wow_comma_ that's super annoying! I understand wanting to get things done early_comma_ but that's not very respectful to neighbors.	0 
nope_comma_ it was very frustrating_comma_ he lives next door too	0 
Have you talked to him about it?	0 
yes i did_comma_ he hasnt done it since	1 
I'm pretty worried about what the future will hold. I lose my job tomorrow. Trying to keep my head up! 	0 
are you getting laid off?	0 
Yes_comma_ unfortunately. We are having a huge company layoff and being a remote employee didn't help my case. 	0 
im sorry_comma_ i hope you're able to find an even better job immediately	1 
I was really scared when Hurricane Irma came through Florida last year. It was a pretty horrible experience.	0 
Do you live in Florida?	0 
I do_comma_ in Orlando. I feel lucky to have had no damage to my home and been in a central location_comma_ but the storm was awful and we had no power for 4 days.	0 
Wow_comma_ that sounds terrifying. You are very lucky to have made it out without any property damage though.	1 
I work online to make extra money for things my family wants.	0 
Thats amazing_comma_ you must be a good person	0 
It's nice to be able to pay for fun things that our budget doesn't allow us to normally do.	0 
How many kids do you have?	1 
i felt bored being by myself all week	0 
Sometimes i like to not have other people asking things of me. Alone can be good.	0 
it was just boring because i had so much work to get done	0 
Well at least you didn't have a lot of people under foot to slow you down. So I hope the sacrifice of being bored was worth it.	1 
My son's school starts next week and they just changed the first day of school!	0 
I am so sorry to hear that!	0 
My husband had to ask off for a different day without much notice!	0 
That is the worst. At least you and your husband got something worked out for your son's first day at school! 	1 
I was looking through my cloud and found some pics of when I was little.	0 
 A walk down memory lane.	0 
Yeah_comma_ it makes me miss being at home and around my family.	0 
Oh I bet! It's always good to cherish those memories.	1 
I was watching my favorite tv show and my husband kept talking to me during it.	0 
oh that can be annoying_comma_ did you tell him anything?	0

hahah that's kinda funny. Maybe he just missed you!	1 
I was glad my dad asked me to go on a mission trip with him.	0 
Nice! Where did you go?	0 
Belize. He did doctor stuff. I didn't do much. But it was cool to see what they were up to.	0 
Oh_comma_ that is really cool! What a great experience_comma_ and fun to bond with your dad!	1 
i was upset sitting in traffic yesterday	0 
Was it long?	0 
about an hour	0 
That's long_comma_ I understand the reason behind you being upset 	1 
My friends were finally coming over to visit_comma_ it had been a long time since I saw them last.	0 
I know how you feel_comma_ it's always good to bond with your buddies when you can	0

Thanks_comma_ yeah it is for a summer class in macroeconomics.	0 
Well congratulation on your A in advance lol	0 
Thanks I know ill get it lol.	1 
A tarantula bit me in my living room the other day and I thought I was going to die.	0 
Oh my gosh! Was it a wild tarantula or a pet?	0 
It was a wild tarantula. I had my family rush me to the hospital_comma_ but I ended up being just fine. It only caused me discomfort for a couple of days.	0 
Thank goodness! The biggest type of spider we have here if a wolf spider. They don't really bite you unless you irritate them.	1 
Last week_comma_ my childhood friend came to visit from out of town. I couldn't stop smiling when we hung out.	0 
Oh awesome! How are they doing?	0 
Great. We were just cracking jokes the whole time. It was good to see him.	0 
Awesome! It's nice to see people who knew you so long ago. No friendships like those!	1 
Yesterday_comma_ my brother came out on the news because he was taking about the new charity he started. I'm glad I have brother with such a good heart.	0 
Wow_comma_ that's really great. What charity did he donate to?	0 
No_comma_ he's starting his own. I'm glad I'm able to call him my bro.	0

I can't wait until we get nice weather. ITs too hot to do anything	1 
I was in a long line at the supermarket the other day. Then some lady just cut right in front of me like nothing.	0 
Some people have no concept of being rude.	0 
It mad me sick! Do they teach these people about manners?	0 
no_comma_ they dont.	1 
I was diagnosed with stage four cancer yesterday. The doctor told me I have less than a month to live.	0 
Are you serious? That is extremely terrible news to hear. :( 	0 
Yes_comma_ I fell to my knees when I heard the news and haven't stopped crying since. My life is pretty much over!	0 
I really wish I knew what to say_comma_ but even watching my mother go thru stage 4 I still dont know what to say! Spend a lot of time with your loved ones! 	1 
When my daughter was a baby she picked up sign language really well.	0 
Really_comma_ isn't that unusual?	0 
Not really_comma_ I was trying to teach her so she could communicate with us and tell us what she wanted.	0 
I'm glad it worked out so well for you all .	1 
Yesterday_comma_ I was at the doctors office all day waiting for my blood tests. I was hoping everything would turn out alright.	0 
I know how stressful that can be. I hope everything turned out alright.	0 
The wait turned out to be worth it because the results showed that everthing was fine.	0 
That is great news!	1 
I was so annoyed earlier - went back to get my car after doing my shopping and someone had hit it and driven off!	0 
That wasn't nice. I hope they caught them.	0 
No unfortunately not.  There were no cameras in the carpark and no one saw anything.  So i am left with the bill.  I hope karma gets them eventually though.	0 
That sucks_comma_ how much is it?	0 
Not sure yet_comma_ I have left it into garage to get priced up but its looks pretty bad. 	1 
I was applying for a manager position at the store I worked at. I felt really sure about the interview.	0

My friends girlfriend kissed me at a party last week. It's been weighing heavy on my mind. Should I tell him?	0 
Why did you wait a week? Tell her to tell him	0 
But_comma_ he's been my best friend since childhood. I think I should be the one to tell him. I just feel so bad. That's why I postponed it.	0 
I don't know. You should have told hime when it happended. Just do it and get uit out of the way so you both can move past it.	1 
i got a letter from my grandmother in the mail today	0 
That's nice. I always like getting letters.	0 
did you ever have a pen pal when you were a child?	0 
no_comma_ I never did. It might have been nice.	1 
My friend won 58 million when he hit the jackpot the other day. I don't understand_comma_ why cant good stuff like that happen to me?	0 
58 million. That's unbelievable.	0 
I couldn't believe he won it because he's so stingy and I'm such a kind hearted person. I deserve it more!	0 
Well_comma_ you know how to get it from  him right?	1 
Yesterday_comma_ I went engagement ring shopping and I picked out the perfect ring for my wife. 	0

No problem. I hope she'll love it as well.	1 
I was upset when my friend forgot to invite me to dinner	0 
Oh no. Did you guys talk about it?	0

No one's perfect. I hope you won't hold a grudge.	1 
I had a major work presentation to give	0 
How'd it go?	0 
It went well_comma_ I felt like I had everything in order	0 
Being prepared pays off soemtimes.	1 
I took a work related placement test for a better position in my company	0 
how did you do on it?	0 
I did well overall_comma_ it was easier than I thought	0 
Good_comma_ well I hope you get the better position!	1 
Just started my budget. Apparently I'm going to be ok. 	0 
How strict is the budget?	0 
Down the last dollar. I have a baby on the way so we've got to bank money	0 
Ah_comma_ that makes sense_comma_ well I hope it goes well for you!	0 
Thank's Im hopeful that we will be able to stick to it. 	1 
i was impressed by my nephews performance at his little league baseball game	0 
Nice. Did his team finish first?	0 
they won the game and he played really well	0 
At his age_comma_ they progress very quickly	1 
i really appreciated all the effort my friends put into my birthday	0 
That's very nice of them! Having caring friends is very important.	0 
yes it is	0 
What did they do for you?	1 
I'm over the road trucker. Man it gets boring in the evenings. 	0 
I bet it does_comma_ you should find a podcast you like	0 
I listen to most of those as I drive. I was thinking of getting into gaming. I have a Tv in the truck and can buy a game system. 	0 
That is smart_comma_ I would recommend a nintendo switch!	0 
Someone told me that on the CB. But I've never heard of it before earlier today. I've got to do something. The boredom is dragging me down.	1 
I see a lot of work coming up at my job	0 
How so?	0 
My supervisor warned me earlier in the week about it	0 
I'm sorry. Any way you can get out of it?	1 
I was scared to fly for the first time	0 
Why's that?	0 
Because I am scared of heights.	0 
Have you always been scared of heights?	1 
i couldnt believe it rained this afternoon after such a sunny morning	0 
Yuck!  You didn't get wet and muddy I hope!	0 
nope it only rained for a few minutes	0 
That is good to hear.  No one likes soggy shoes!	1 
I was really proud of my friend for doing a backflip	0 
Backflips are scary. Neck injury is serious.	0 
Yes_comma_ but luckily he completed it without hurting anything.	0 
Thats good! They do look cool too.	1 
I was scared to fly for the first time	0 
I was scared the first and only time I flew also. Where were you flying to?	0 
Europe. So a long flight!	0 
Oh wow! I bet that was really exciting. I have never been out of the country.	1 
I feel bad for forgetting about my mom's birthday	0 
You must feel horrible!  Get her something extra nice and I am sure she will forgive you!	0 
What should I get her?	0 
Get her flowers and a gift certificate to a nice massage place!	1 
I was thinking about how I missed my grandma	0 
I have the same feeling. I miss her also	0 
She passed last year. She is in a better place.	0 
Sorry to hear that	1 
I have a work project coming up that needs to be completed	0 
Are you going to have it completed in time?  I hope you are not behind schedule!	0 
I still have much to be done	0 
Ouch!  You better knuckle down and burn the midnight oil!	1 
So I walked into work this morning. I have a new boss. He's 20 and had a PhD. I'm amazed.	0 
Wow! I would be amazed too!	0 
A little worried. While super smart as we get older we gain real world experience in dealing with people that you can not learn in a book. But still at 20 I was struggling with my associates degree. 	0 
That's so true. Im 30 and just now having the time to work on my bachelors. But I have a lot of work experience.	0 
I'm 34 and still working on the BA as well. When life got in the way education had to take a back seat.	0 
Same here. Well I hope he can adapt and do well. Good luck with your BA too!	1 
So ever single day my boss is late to work. 20 minutes or more. Today I was 1 minute late_comma_ first time in 2 years and I got a wrote up.	0 
Wow. That's pretty hypocritical.	0 
Yea_comma_ I even called and let them know the highway was closed down and I was going to be late. I even text her photo of the traffic accident once I got up to it.	0 
I think she's just trying to cause a problem.	1 
I was hungry and took my co-workers food	0 
Did you not have your own food?	0 
I didn't have any that day_comma_ I was also out of money	0 
Oh no! That sounds horrible! Did the co-worker find out?	1 
This morning I don't know what got into me but on the way to work I picked up a homeless guy. 	0 
Oh wow. Give me the details.	0 
Yea_comma_ as I pulled over I thought it was someone down on his luck. Nope_comma_ he was crazy.	0 
Are you missing an organs?	0 
Haha_comma_ it started off ok. He was going to the train station. I agreed to take him. With in minutes he was talking to him self. 	0 
Well_comma_ At least you're in one piece. you could have been in several.	1 
Went on a first date last weekend. Had some sort of BBQ appetizer early in the date. Yummy_comma_ yea well not really! 	0 
Not really? How come?	0 
Well_comma_ after about an hour I got up to pee. As I washed my hands I looked up and my face was covered with sauce. It looked like someone poured it on my face_comma_ 	0 
Oh wow_comma_ the BBQ must be delicious.	0 
yea_comma_ I will not see here again but I will be seeing the BBQ again this weekend. 	1 
Do you ever wake up and realize how lucky we are? I travel a lot and I just got back from Haiti. I'm convinced it's better to be poor in America then rich in Haiti.	0 
That's a profound thought. We definitely take America for granted_comma_ especially when some people say it's in its "worst state in a long time." We're prisoners of the moment.	0 
Those that criticize have not traveled the real world out side resort gates or into the third world. Then you see a real state that is in trouble.	0 
Yeah_comma_ I guess you would know for sure_comma_ since you've seen it first hand. Especially a place like Haiti_comma_ that's just gets pounded with hurricanes. What brought you to Haiti_comma_ if you don't mind me asking?	0 
I travel a lot. My self and my wife try to see 2-3 new cultures a year. 	1 
Monday I was downtown for work. I was on my way home when a homeless man asked form some money. I went to reach for my wallet and it was gone.	0 
I am sorry to hear that.Is there a chance you forgot your wallet home?	0 
No it was stolen. So when I went to reach for it. The homeless man could tell something was wrong. He actually paid for my train ticket home. I end up seeing him again today. Took him out to lunch and gave him some money.	0 
That story could become a movie script.	0 
I really want to help him get his life together. 	1 
All I want in life this weekend is to sleep and I have to work. 	0 
That?Coffee dose even phase me anymore. The lack of sleep is making my soul sad.	0 
Try drinking a lot of water and cutting out soda	0 
I'll try that. 	1 
This weekend was supposed to be my first weekend off in 2 months. 	0 
Is it not going to happen?	0 
Nope_comma_ my boss who only works one weekend a month has decided this month she is not going to work any weekends.	0 
That sucks. 	0 
Yea_comma_ she is not a very good boss and now I'm super bummed. 	0 
You should find another job. No use being miserable. Or tell her boss!	1 
I recently took my ELS certification test. I studied really hard_comma_ so I'm sure I passed it.	0 
What's ELS?	0 
Sorry_comma_ ESL. It's English as a Second Language. It just means I am certified to teach students that don't speak fluent English.	0 
Ah_comma_ gotcha. A few of my friends teach English to Chinese students online and I think they have taken ESL courses	1 
I just moved into my new house and I am having a cockroach problem.	0 
That really sucks! What do you have to do?	0 
I'm just using Raid right now_comma_ but I will call an exterminator tomorrow. I hate bugs so I am freaking out a little bit.	0 
I do too.  I am so sorry you are going through this	1 
When I was in New York_comma_ I got to see STOMP. It was an amazing show.	0 
Wow. I had that DVD.	0 
I used to watch it in music class a lot. I am fascinated by the way they make music with everyday items.	0 
I know. I wonder if they still do that show	0 
This was just a few years ago_comma_ so hopefully.	1 
I love my dad. He only made me pay half of the money I owed him and let me keep the rest for my pet deposit.	0 
Some dads are cool like that. My mom is that way sometimes.	0 
I was shocked. I was fully prepared to pay the full thing. He's great.	0 
I just went on a trip with my mom and sh paid for almost everything	1 
my bus broke down and i was late for work_comma_ again!	0 
Are you a busdriver?	0 
no i ride a bus to work. this has happened twice in the past month. i need to get a car	0 
Ah_comma_ gotcha. I hate it when things happen out of our control. Hope you get it figured out	1 
Hey there	0 
Hi what you got going on?	0 
Uhm.. just feeling blue. My gf broke up with me recently and got married to an investment banker	0 
That is really sad.  Are you alright?	0 
i guess so.. i mean_comma_ we were the same age. This guy was like 5-6 years elder_comma_ so ahead of me in life. i tried convincing her to give me a bit more time.. well.	1 
I feel so bad that i failed my last semester exam	0

Hopefully your friend can make it up to you and hang out with you some time soon.	1 
my parents went on vacation and i am left aloe in the house	0 
Ha_comma_ hope you aren't too scarred about being all by yourself.	0 
i am scared_comma_ especially at night	0 
Watching too many horror movies I bet. Just put on some comedy special.	1 
Man I am so glad I was able to climb out of poverty.	0 
That's quite an accomplishment. You must have worked very hard.	0 
I was homeless for about a year.  It felt like every day I would just descened even further.  But I always held out hope that things would get better.	0 
That must have been a very hard time. Your persistence led you to this success because you never gave up that hope.	0 
Well there was a little luck in there as well.  I certainly feel a little blssed by my current situation.	1 
I'm so pleased with myself right now.  I saved up enough money to make all of my car payments at once next month.	0 
That's very good. It takes a disciplined person to save money	0 
Heh_comma_ well I didn't exactly save money that mush.  I just hunkered down and started working harder and asked for more hours.	0 
You truely are determined to get that car_comma_ what brand is it?	0 
It's a Kia Soul.  I hope to trade it in someday to cover the down payment on an electric car.	1 
i am confident i am going to pass my exam	0 
I hope you pass your exam. Did you do good at your exam?	0 
yes_comma_ i always read hard	0 
Good luck	1 
Man I had an absolute blast from the past last week.	0 
Really? What happened? 	0 
I found my old elementary school.  I hear it was going to be torn down next month_comma_ so I toured the inside.	0 
Wow_comma_ cool! Did they let you in? It's so cool you had that opportunity.	0 
Yeah.  It was mostly abandoned anyway.  Memeories filled my head anyway and I found myself in the past again.	1 
Yeah I went to a used car lot yesterday to check out a car I saw on the internet.  Not happy.	0 
Ick. I've never heard of anyone having a really good experience with that.	0 
Well I realzied that the owner had taken the pictures of the car from a large distance.  Up close it was very disappointing.	0 
Ah_comma_ I see. The classic photo trick. I understand why you would be upset about that. That's definitly why it's so important to go see before you buy	0 
Well I know I won't be buying anything from that place!	1

Oh really? Any reason why?	0 
Yeah I was buying something in electronics and this guy shows up out of nowhere and starts criticizing my purchase!	0 
Wow really? That's pretty rude and bad in general for an employee to be doing.	0 
That's the thing!  It wasn't an employee_comma_ it was another customer!	1 
You'll never guess what I saw on the road today.	0 
Do tell	0 
I saw a bear crossing the road a mile from my job.	0 
That's neat! I've only seen ducks and chickens. A deer did bounce over my car once_comma_ though	0 
Yet it really shocked me.  But he just ran off_comma_ so not much excitement.	1 
Man I was so stoked to check my bank account today	0 
I guess it didn't turn out well?	0 
No man it was GREAT.  I finally got my first paycheck after my rasie!	0 
oh.  SWEET!  Congrats!  What are you going to do with all that money??	0 
Well I was gonna buy a few video games_comma_ but I'll of course set some aside.  No need to go crazy.	0 
Save it for Spider-Man that comes out next month!  I can't wait for that	0 
Thinking about it!  But  I may not have to_comma_ as by then I'll get another paycheck at this pay grade!	0 
And more to come hopefully!  Don't forget to save for retirement and/or emergency fund :D	1 
hi	0 
Hello	0

Am doing well thanks and you?	0 
fine ya.thank you	1 
hi	0 
hi	0 
how are you?	0 
fine. But_comma_ I think you're suppose to do the prompts_comma_ so hope it doesn't cause you a rejection.	0 
not for the rejections	1 
hi	0 
What have your experiences been like?	0 
so nice my experience.	0 
That's good to hear! Hope that it continues that way.	0 
yes	1 
I feel angry i have to pay with an interest	0 
Oh I hate that. Is it a high interest rate?	0 
yes_comma_ it is exorbitant just to say	0 
It's highway robbery. Well I can only hope you can pay it quickly to avoid as much of that as possible.	1 
One of my friends sent me a lot of money for my birthday right when I needed it a lot.	0 
You read	0 
I do read a lot of articles.	0 
That's great _comma_ sorry for the error and unrelated message previously sent :) but you do have great friend that are dependable	0 
Yes_comma_ he's one of my best friends and I really appreciated the help.  He's like a brother to me.  And it's okay about the error.	1 
There was one time when I was in grade school and the fire alarm went off when I was in the bathroom.  I had a hard time buttoning my pants up and had to walk out holding them together in front of my classmates.	0 
Oh my god_comma_ that must have been so embarrasing! Was there actually a fire?	0 
Nope_comma_ it turned out to be a fire drill.  Everyone was laughing at me.  It wasn't one of my prouder moments.	0 
Its okay_comma_ at least now you can look back at it as a funny moment.	1 
I am sitting here and guessing when will the wi-fi stop working.	0 
Oh no_comma_ I hate having connectivity problems! Are you having bad weather?	0 
Yep its raining cats and dogs in here.	0 
Oh_comma_ it has been raining here a lot too. I will keep my fingers crossed that your wi-fi keeps working!	1 
Is anyone here?	0 
Yes_comma_ I am here	0 
Yes_comma_ I had fully charged it and after like 6-7 rides it had 3% left.	0 
Oh no_comma_ I bet that was stressful. What did you do?	0 
Well_comma_ I called the very last customer and made sure he only was traveling like 5-6 miles and that the system wouldn't die. It worked out.	1 
Recently I've been enjoying being by myself.	0 
I like my alone time too. What do you enjoy doing by yourself?	0 
I just love people watch_comma_ if that's considered alone time.	0 
Oh that's is fun. It's a way to be alone with your thoughts_comma_ but still be around others. I love to watch people! 	1 
When I wake up and know that I am doing the things that I like_comma_ I feel great.	0 
Yes I can related to that feeling	0 
I don't think people realize iportance of that in their life.	0 
Well_comma_ a great morning leads to a great day 	1 
i watched a horror movie and i feel terrified and anxious all the time	0 
Which movie did you watch?	0 
lost 	0 
That is a very scary movie! How are you coping?	1 
It was really hurtful	0 
What was hurtful may I ask?	0 
Well_comma_ they made me leave everything at my desk_comma_ walked me downstairs_comma_ turn in my badge_comma_ and would mail my belonings.	0 
That sounds like very bad treatment_comma_ You should sue them	0 
Yah_comma_ I feel like it. Thanks for understanding.	1 
I feel very strange for not feeling any remorse about anything really.	0 
Maybe you haven't done anything terribly wrong that anyone would feel remorseful about. Do you think that's it?	0 
I think it might just be a stage in life.	0 
Maybe. It's none of my business but sometimes when people feel this way_comma_ they could be experiencing depression. 	1 
Is it terribleto always feel ok_comma_ and not wait for the bad times	0 
I suppose it is.	0 
Than I will go on feeling this way I guess_comma_ or do I have another option?	0 
You always have options!	1 
She was actually always blind-sinding nice to my face and back-stabbing the other.	0 
Sounds like someone who is actually not a friend. How long have you known her?	0 
I have known her less than a year.	0 
I used to work with a girl like that. She always talked bad about me but was nice to my face.	0 
Yah_comma_ I can't stand when that happens. Just so wrong.	1 
Do you ever feel that now you have finally grasped what life really is..	0 
I can't say that I really do. It's always a mystery in my mind.	0 
Or is the sign of overconfidence_comma_ like they say_comma_ -  there are two types of bikes_comma_ those that were in an accident_comma_ and those that will be?	0 
I believe I see it more as that type. No one can truly know.	1 
Some markets have to be avoided_comma_ that is if you valued your sense of smell.	0 
I know what you mean. Wednesdays there's this market I like to go to_comma_ but lately it just has so much rotten food	0 
Yet there's still something about that imperfection_comma_ do you agree?	0 
Totally. I still love to go have a look around	1 
Don't you think that the only one really capable of bringing you down_comma_ is you?	0 
Yes_comma_ it is partially true. What is the problem?	0 
There aren't any_comma_ I am just drawing a conclusion from past experience. 	0 
I understand.	1 
Sometime all it take is one rude person to ruin your day.	0 
That is very true. Did something bad happen to you?	0 
Nothing major_comma_ but I am still learning how to deal with such behavior and always open for an advice. 	0 
Generally just try to ignore it as best as you can. I'm good about just letting things roll off my back.	1 
when i went for shopping i parked my car at a no parking zone which i am not aware _comma_ police approached the car and was about to tow it away	0 
Oh no! Those can be difficult to spot sometimes.	0 
yes exactly _comma_ but i also had my 4 6 month old 11 month old baby with me .	0 
Wow. That must have been stressful. I have babies_comma_ too. Did they understand?	0 
ya after they had seen my 11 month old baby with me they felt they should not trouble me by towing away car . i felt very thankful to them	0 
That is a relief. Sounds like you made it just in time.	0 
yes some people are very understanding and helpful	1 
gosh ive been feeling so nervous for the past 24 hours_comma_ its almost like an impending sense of doom_comma_ To my knowledge theres nothing about to go wrong or blow up in my face but it feels like something is going badly	0 
I get it. Sometimes I feel stressed out for no real reason myself.	0 
i ordered some semi expensive tablet yesterday so maybe its that but like_comma_ i cant think of a logical reason why that would go wrong so im left wondering why i feel so nervous_comma_ its really weird_comma_ very hard to relax like this	0 
Well sometimes companies make mistakes. I doubt it's anything you did.	1 
I've been recently thinking about the things we don't appreciate.	0 
I think it's very common that we take things for granted. 	0 
Is there anything that can change that?	0 
I think you can really think about all that you have_comma_ and show your thanks that you have these things. 	1 
Yah_comma_ was depressing.	0 
What was depressing?	0 
Well_comma_ just really did a lot of housework and felt we lost contact.	0 
Oh_comma_ that sounds like a bummer. Do you think it will change?	0 
Yes_comma_ it got so much better the next few days.	1 
have you ever watched this show it was really quite good?	0 
What is the name of the show?	0 
It was called Hero's	0 
No_comma_ I ever did.	0 
it was actually quite good	1 
I am currently waiting to receive my security deposit back from my old apartment.	0 
why hasnt it already been returned?	0 
They said it takes up to 30 days_comma_ and it's only been a few weeks.	0 
if you live in america and they fail to return it in a timely manner_comma_ i hear you can go to small claims and get 3x the amount awarded to you 	0 
Wow_comma_ that's good to know.	0 
yeah r/legaladvice has a lot of posts like that so its something that stuck to me_comma_ Pretty neat to know that landlords cant just scam you	1 
I ordered a surface pro yesterday! its gonna be so cool to play around with when it arrives	0 
That's cool. I've always been a Mac kind of girl_comma_ but I would look into a Surface is I was in the market for a new computer.	0 
i only ever wanted one cause they can do the same stuff a regular computer can but also touch screen so you can draw on it_comma_ i always got discouraged drawing on paper cause id waste so much of it_comma_ and then just stop	0 
I get that. I got a bamboo tablet a few years ago_comma_ but I feel like working directly on the screen would be even better.	1 
It was such a sweet moment.	0 
what was ?	0 
Spending time watching TV and sipping wine together.	0 
oh that does sound nice	0 
Do you like wine?	1 
As the day was coming to an end_comma_ I was begging to believe that my solitude was perfect.  	0 
Well in some ways solitude is nice.	0 
Yes if you take it in portions. 	0 
True everything is nice in bits. Too much of anything does get tiring.	1 
But I needed to be responsible.	0 
Be responsible about what?	0 
Well_comma_ about getting daily chorses done--work first-- play later.	0 
I understand. I have to get work around my house done today too_comma_ before I can go out.	0 
Yes_comma_ it teaches us self-pride.	1 
I got backed into last week by another car.	0 
Oh no_comma_ sorry to hear_comma_ hope you are OK.	0 
I'm fine_comma_ but they left a nasty dent in the front of my car. Now I have to get it fixed_comma_ which is a hassle.	0 
I agree. Hope the car will look good again.	1 
Meh i kinda feel bad_comma_ i wish i had family members to talk to	0 
Sorry to hear that. Did you try to talk to a friend?	0 
friends are cool but its not quite the same as a family member_comma_ a spouse would be but i dont have that either!	0 
I understand	1 
Yah_comma_ two colored socks is crazy.	0 
I agree_comma_ where did you find them?	0 
LOL_comma_ mixed up in my drawer.	0 
Oh I see_comma_ Ha! I would have just worn them like that to be more fashionable!	0 
Yes_comma_ funny.	1 
when i was travelling alone in a car at night in ghat road suddenly some boulders fell on the road 	0 
Was it an accident?	0 
no the boulders fell 50 meters infront of me _comma_ luckily i was going slow and suddenly stopped	0 
Oh ! Thank good ness! That was close	0 
yes but i am so much worried for what happened that night	1 
I ate so many macadamia nuts today_comma_ I don't know how to feel about it.	0 
do you especially enjoy macadamia nuts or just eating?	0 
It the only nut that I can eat_comma_ that's why I can't help overeating.	0 
It must be difficult living with a nut allergy. Do you overeat on macadamia nuts regularly?	1 
its sooooooo hot outside_comma_ 30c. its borderline impossible to deal with	0 
It's awful out there. It's been in the 100's here in TX	0 
oh no_comma_ texas is basically in a desert isnt it. for me on top of heat i also get some 3 wasps a day flying into my apartament and looking around_comma_ i just got one earlier and had to kill it to get rid of it. very annoying_comma_ apparently wasps love it though	0 
That sucks! I hate wasps and most other bugs_comma_ so I feel your annoyance.	0 
spiders are really the worst_comma_ thankfully it looks like the heat was useful for Something at least and killed them off	1 
I start back at work in a couple of weeks.	0 
what job did you apply to?	0 
I'm a teacher_comma_ so I've been off this summer. I am looking forward to having 12th graders again this year.	0 
Somehow i suspect that theyre not looking forward to having you though :P (no offence) i cant remember anyone that enjoyed high school lol. Its a good job though! literally backbone of society	0 
Haha_comma_ true. I try to make it a little more enjoyable for them_comma_ but I've also been in their shoes.	1 
I always trust my family like my mom to give me good advice.	0 
Yeah that's always comforting.  Mom's are awesome	0 
Do you ever disagree with your Mom?	0 
Not really.  We usually tend to think alike.  Why do you ask?  	0 
Aww_comma_ I didn't really relate until I had children of my own	0 
Cool.  So you're the awesome mother here?	0 
We both are.	1 
i was really pissed off when i found out my best friend slept with my girlfriend. i was shaking all over!	0 
I'm sorry to hear that	0 
yeah well. what you gonna do.. thats life..	0 
:( did you stay friends with him?	0 
hell no.. i could never look at him again	1 
i had recently applied for graduate masters in very prestigious universities but initially i was worried whether i get admission or not	0 
did you get admission? 	0 
yeah i thought the competition was tough and i may not get admitted_comma_ but luckily i was admitted	0 
That's great news_comma_ well done. 	0 
yes i am totally relived of that stress now	0 
:) 	1 
I hate when I am tired.	0 
Me too_comma_ especially when it's still the middle of the day.	0 
or in the case here_comma_ morning	0 
Oh yes_comma_ you're right. I'm in the same boat right now!	0 
I just need six good hours of sleep	1 
i ate 3 pizzas just earlier and i feel so good and relaxed now_comma_ almost tranquility	0 
I think I am missing something_comma_ you said you feel more that ok after 3 pizzas???	0 
yeah i know right_comma_ a lot_comma_ and i am pretty thin so i shouldnt feel ok_comma_ But i totally do feel great .	0 
It's definitely some kind of anomaly. 	0 
i think you just dont appreciate how good pizza is	1 
Sometime ago I was really hungry and decided to treat myself to some well reviewed restaurant_comma_ well it was all I hoped for.	0 
What did you eat there? 	0 
Onion soup with croutons.	0 
ooooh onion soup sounds really good_comma_ onions do taste incredibly well if cooked well with the correct dish	1 
i was extremely disgusted when a close friend of mine threw up on my baby. he was really drunk at a party we were at	0 
I would have flipped and never talked to him again. I am so sorry my god what did you do? 	0 
what else can i do? i washed my kid clean and got the hell out of there	0 
Idk beat him up_comma_ lol. throw a drink at him_comma_ the sky is the limit! 	1 
I just finished making my bulletin board at work.	0

I'm happy with it. Hopefully my students like it too.	0 
if you put so much work into it_comma_ im sure they will	1 
i was so angry when i found out that my girlfriend cheated on me.. dont know how i can forgive her	0 
I am so sorry! I would have a hard time forgiving that betrayal of trust. How long have you been together?	0 
3 years	0 
Wow. I hope that you can work it out_comma_ but I would understand why you wouldn't want to.	1 
I really feel nostalgic around christmas	0

i actually feel like a kid even now during christmas	1 
my dad gave me the greatest gift ever on my graduation	0 
wow_comma_ what was it?	0 
a brand new ford car_comma_ i was thrilled	0 
woohoo! you are one lucky child!	1 
i felt really good about my change to new york after getting a job	0 
No way! I just moved from NY to FL. You are going to love NY tho_comma_ its an awesome state. Congrats on the job! 	0 
thank you so much.. i moved from Idaho.. so this is very new to me_comma_ all this	0 
Oh yeah sounds like its super new to you especially if you are in the city. I was in the middle of no where so pretty much felt like Idaho where I lived in NY. :p 	1 
i felt heartbroken when my girlfriend moved away without telling me first	0 
I would too why would she not tell you!? Did yall break up? 	0 
we had a fight_comma_ i never knew we were broken up though	0 
That sounds like poor communication on her part maybe its better for you she moved. :/ 	1 
hi there it was a hard day when this incident occured.	0 
What incident was that ?	0 
i was driving home and it started to rain	0 
what happened then ?	0 
my tire went out and was going to call fro help. I didn't get a chance to call.	1 
my dad passed away around the time of christmas.. it always casts a shadow over my holidays	0 
I know what you mean_comma_ it sucks when those "dates" linger over us even if we try not to think about them. Im so sorry to hear that! 	0 
yeah.. i know it is time to get over it. but certain memories are so haunting	0 
Its not time to get over it_comma_ you arent doing any wrong its okay to "feel" things. I hope people around you give you a lot of love! 	1 
i feel like my dog is my child time after another.. love him so much	0 
i understand what you are saying_comma_ pets are always close to our hearts	0 
very true_comma_ do you have any pets?	0 
yeah_comma_ i have 2 german shepards	1 
i was shaking when i was watching conjuring in the movies	0 
is it a scary movie?	0 
it is a terrifying movie. havent you seen it yet?	0 
no i never heard of it	1 
yesterday i was so angry at my parents.. but i kept my mouth shut and came away. i cant hurt them_comma_ i feel so faithful	0 
yea thats probably the best choice to make	0 
i always think all those hard times they had bringing me up	0 
i can understand that	1 
some guy threw up on the street last night right before me.. i was grossed out	0 
Yuck_comma_ that is terrible. I would be grossed out too. What did you do?	0 
i got the hell out of there right away!	0 
I'm sure you did. Guess he couldn't make it to the trash can.	1 
I saw some pictures recently of when my family and I went on vacation when I was little.	0 
oh thats really sweet!	0 
Yeah_comma_ it made me sad to see it because they I live so far away now.	0 
oh no.. i hope you feel better	1 
i love thinking about fond memories with my family	0 
Those are great aren'	0 
do you have a large family?	0 
Sorry(Those are great aren't they?) I do not but we always had sunday breakfast for many years. Those memories are to be cherished and repeated :)	1 
My roommate recently moved out of my house so now it is just me and my dog.  My dog is really nice and doesn't really bark unless he sees a stranger coming up to the house.  Lately he has been sitting at the top of the steps to the basement and growls/barks.  However_comma_ there are no windows to the basement and he wouldnt be able to see into the basement.  I have no idea why he has been barking at that door lately.	0 
wow that is a lot to take in.  get a muzzle	0 
I'm not bothered by him barking.  As someone who watches a lot of scary movies it is more of a worry factor that someone is down there than anything.	0 
i can understand that	1 
I got a job offer at another company that pays more_comma_ but I turned them down because I've been with my current company for ten years.	0 
Do you think it was the right decision?	0 
Definitely_comma_ my company always treat's me right. They haven't gave me a reason to want to leave. 	0 
That's great. Maybe you will get a raise too	1 
i felt shy when i dropped my groceries in the parking lot	0 
why is that	0 
because there were soda cans rolling all around the parking lot and i was scrambling to pick them all up	0 
oh i can understand that	1 
The other day an intruder broke into my home. I had to hide in the closet while I called the cops.	0 
That must have been terrifying	0 
It was_comma_ the whole time I was shaking and breathing heavily.	0 
I don't know what I would have done	1 
My dog Lola won first place in the dog show. That's my girl!	0 
Awesome! What kind of dog is Lola?	0 
She's a Pekingese. When they handed me the trophy I just couldn't stop smiling. She's the best dog I could ask for.	0 
I don't think I would have been able to stop smiling either! That is so awesome!	1 
i was happy this morning when i received an email from my grandma	0 
That's nice_comma_ is she technologically savvy?	0 
not really but she tries haha	0 
Well it's nice she's making the effort!	1 
i love reading old letters from family members	0 
I do too. I have a box filled with them. How old is your oldest?	0 
i have some old ones from the korean war	0 
wow!	1 
I have everything ready for back to school supplies for my son to start school.	0 
That's good. Now you don't have to worry about it.	0 
That is true! I also have his outfit picked out for the first day of school.	0 
Wow_comma_ your son is lucky to have a parent who is on top of things!	1 
I bet my cousin that I could beat him at a game of basketball. He's horrible at playing so I knew I could beat him.	0 
What did you bet?	0 
I bet him $1000 because that's how good I am. I had no doubt in my mind I could win. I ended up obliterating him and taking his shoes too.	0 
That would be awesome! Did your cousin pay you?	1 
i was sad to hear my mom is in the ER again	0 
Oh no_comma_ I am sorry to hear that. I hope she is okay.	0 
me too_comma_ she has heart problems unfortunately	0 
I am so sorry. I hope she is able to get some relief and rest.	0 
thank you i appreciate the kind words	1 
My son said his first word the other day. My little man is going to be smart just like his pop's.	0 
Oh man! That must have been great to hear! What did he say?	0 
He said poop. When I heard It I jumped up with joy. That's my boy!	0 
That's so funny! That's one of those things you will definitely remember forever!	1 
im envious of my friends who are at the park right now while im stuck inside	0 
Oh I can understand that! I would also like to be outside; it looks like such a beautiful day! At least it is almost the weekend!	0 
thats true_comma_ i'll be outside in an hour or less!	0 
That's great! Are you going to join your friends at the park?	1 
I was walking through a trail to get to my house last night and it was pitch black. I was afraid a bear or something might get me lol	0 
You should have taken a flashlight just in case. 	0 
I was gonna use my phone but it died_comma_ so I just sprinted for like half an hour.	0 
hey at least you got a nice workout in!	0 
Yeah way to look at it positive lol. There was a river nearby so at least it sounded kind of relaxing.	0 
That is true. Well I'm glad you made it home safely. Maybe next time maybe go a little earlier before it gets so dark out.	0 
For sure_comma_ or at least charge my phone haha. Thx I'm glad I didnt get mauled by a bear too	1 
 i felt sick after eating too much ice cream last night	0 
I had ice cream too! Sorry you got sick	0 
its my own fault i went past my limit lol	0 
Ha_comma_ at least it was good	1 
I took my pup to the park last weekend and he had fun meeting other dogs and their owners!	0 
Thats always fun! Does your pup do well with other dogs?	0 
Yeah he is a golden so he is happy no matter what lol. He will go up to people and not leave until they pet him.	0 
Mine does the same thing. Goldens are so adorable.	0 
Absolutely! What kind of dog do you have?	0 
He is just a mix breed. We really don't even know.	0 
Mixed breeds usually look really cool.	1 
So I was drunk coming back from a party and woke up to find I peed the bed lol. First time in like 24 years.	0 
lol_comma_ it happens to us all	0 
Yea you cant help but feel like a stupid little kid or something_comma_ at least I did lol.	0 
haha true	0 
Got any crazy drinking stories?	1 
i felt dumb when I lost my receipt	0 
That sucks did you need to return something?	0 
yes some printer ink	0 
That stuff is pretty expensive. Maybe you can sell it on eBay or something.	1 
So I was on the bus back from a party and a drunk guy barfed on me at a stop lol. Most of it got on my jacket and he didnt even apologize.	0 
Oh wow! I would have been so disgusted and outraged! What did you do?	0 
Well I didn't want to start a fight or anything_comma_ so I just took it off and held my nose the rest of the ride. Then I washed it like 6 times lol	0 
That must have been a terrible experience. I'm not sure that I would be able to wear that jacket again.	0 
I wouldnt have but it was a pretty expensive northface I had for many years.	1 
I can't wait for college in the fall! I left 2 years ago and am back feeling more confident in my studying abilities.	0 
i hope you do really well	0 
Thanks anything youre looking forward to?	0 
going to see some old friends this weekend	0 
Cool when was the last time you saw them?	1 
i was happy with myself for working hard this week	0 
Good job what did you work hard on?	0 
my job and at the gym	0 
Nice keep it up!	1 
I got back into college after 2 years off and I'm pretty proud of myself.	0 
That is awesome!  What are you studying	0 
Ya thanks it's mechanical engineering I have 2 years left.	0 
was it hard to go back or are you enjoying it?	0 
Oh I am going back in a few weeks. It will probably be hard but I will enjoy it for sure.	0 
Well good luck!  I am sure you will do great!	0 
Thank you! I sure hope so.	1 
So last weekend it poured rain all day and I chilled at my house by myself. Pretty boring.	0 
I do like the rain though	0 
It is relaxing_comma_ the only thing is that you can't do anything outside really. Had some plans but they got canceled.	0 
I am sure you will have plans again	0 
That's true_comma_ it's good to look forward to the future.	0 
Yeah_comma_ I am sure it will be fine	0 
Yeah did you do anything exciting last weeked?	1 
I saw a dude driving a Porsche down the street of my city. Was definitely jealous lol	0 
I would have been to. I always wonder how people make the money necessary to buy vehicles like that.	0 
Yeah I am thinking this guy must be a CEO or something. If I had the money I would buy one for sure.	0 
Same here. I saw a Ferrari at the supermarket the other day. I was jealous_comma_ and I also thought about how I would be worried something would happen to it (if it were mine).	0 
Yeah I guess if something happened you are probably rich enough to just buy another lol.	1 
Yesterday_comma_ I ate a whole pizza by myself!	0

She hasn't returned any of my calls. I feel horrible.	0 
Oh no! Well_comma_ honestly if she can't deal with one mistake_comma_ then it's no good anyhow. But maybe it was something else. Sometimes people just don't click.	1 
Yesterday was my first time at a karaoke bar. I started to get all tense when my friends kept telling my I should go on stage to perform.	0 
I feel you! I don't like to perform in front of people either. Did you decline?	0 
No_comma_ I ended up going through with it. I was worried that they would boo me at first because my singing is horrible_comma_ but I guess everyone was too drunk to care.	0 
Oh you can be as bad as you want there_comma_ it just matters if you're having fun :)	1

they were probably on heroine or something	1 
Went on a first date last night. I had chocolate from the appetizer in my beard the entire time. 	0 
Lol. Why didn't she tell you?	0 
I don't know. She was strange. I did not notice until I went to the restroom right before I left. 	0

Gotta have brains	1 
It's been over a year since my last cup of coffee. Today was the day I taste the sweet juice of the god's again.	0 
Why did you stop?	0 
To show my self I had self control. I was drinking like 5 cups a day.	0

Yes_comma_ It is so hard to describe honestly!	0 
But it is also the best feeling ever! Enjoy every moment!	0

What did you almost buy?	0 
I saw this great used car in a print ad_comma_ and went to the dealership_comma_ but when I got there_comma_ it was all ratty and crappy looking!	0

Yes_comma_ but if you don't run away from it_comma_ there wont be any fear.	0 
It's good to face your fears	1 
I had some thought come into my mind_comma_ and they turned me red.	0

It is difficult feeling isolated.  I miss them a lot.	0 
In the end is the trade off worth it?	0 
I don't really know_comma_ to be honest.  It pays our bills_comma_ and it is fun work_comma_ but it is hard.	1 
I saw robert downey jr the other day.. such an awesome experience	0

It is really good to have that level of discipline	1 
I want the ingredients all on my table before i cook	0 
Same here.  It helps make cooking go smoother.	0 
There is something so nice about being prepared fully	0 
Agreed.  No sense wasting time while cooking by looking for odds and ends.	0

How much better did it pay?	0 
5k. But i am satisfied with my current firm	0 
That is not too much_comma_ I think you made a good choice	1

I gave a long_comma_ drawn out presentation at school the other day. I found the task to be very daunting.	0 
That sounds tough.  How do you think you did?	0 
Horrible_comma_ my palms were sweaty the entire time. I hate talking in front of large crowds.	0 
Me_comma_ too--I'm sorrry you had to go through that.  At least it's over now_comma_ right?	1 
My friend got accepted into Harvard University. That's my dream school. I don't understand how someone as dumb as him can get accepted there_comma_ and i'm stuck at community college.	0 
Maybe they know a friend who knows a friend.	0 
That's what i'm thinking_comma_ it's not what you know it's who you know.	0 
Yep_comma_ that's the way of the world_comma_ especially with Universities to.	1 
i recently ordered earphones online but i receive duplicate product	0 
A duplicate? Like a fake?	0 
yes i received a fake product _comma_ the make of earphones is very well known brand 	0 
That  sucks.  I'd be very upset.      You have to be careful who you order from online.  Some times if the price is too goot to be true its a fake product.	0 
yes that s true _comma_ i regularly buy online but this is the first time i experienced this.	1 
I had the worst day ever yesterday.  I had just finished a long_comma_ hard day at work_comma_ I had driven the 40 minutes home_comma_ was just driving into my street and realised that I had left my bag with phone_comma_ purse and most importantly my house keys back in the office!	0 
Oh no that is so frustrating! What did you do?	0 
Well I wanted to cry and scream_comma_ I was so cross with myself but unfortunately as I live alone I just had to drive the 40 minutes back to the office to get them then another 40mins back home.  Where i swiftly had a little glass of wine to help lol.	0 
Ah yes_comma_ a glass of wine might help to make that feel better. Still_comma_ what a pain. Lousy end to a lousy day. 	0 
Exactly_comma_ so irritating.  But hey you live and learn_comma_ I guarantee you I will never leave work again without double then triple checking that I have all my belongings with me!	0 
I would be so lost without my phone_comma_ but I could make it through an evening. The house keys though! 	1 
I was shocked to see $200.00 included with the card.	0 
Was it some fraudulent transaction posted on your account?	0 
No not at all_comma_ She justed wanted to make sure I had a good birthday.	0 
So_comma_ it was your partner who used you card	1 
one month back i went for a wildlife safari _comma_ where i was attacked by a wild boar 	0 
Oh no! Was anyone hurt?	0 
ya i had bruises on my leg 	0 
That's pretty scary.  Did the boar survive the ordeal?	0 
it attacked me and ran into the bushes . it was a very bad experience.	0 
Are you willing to go on another safari?	0 
no i am done with such trips.	0 
I'm not surprised.	1 
My husbands brother was getting married.  I searched online and in every shop to find the perfect dress.  I finally found it_comma_ tried it on and loved it.  I couldnt buy it until the following week as I had to wait to payday so I left it over in the store.  The next day my sister in law called in.  She had been shopping and had also found the perfect dress.  She took it out of the bag to show me and I discovered it was the same dress!! Couldnt believe it.  Oh how I resented her at that moment.	0 
That's very intense. I am sorry you had to experience that.	0 
Oh if envy could kill - she would have been dead on the spot.  Needless to say I got over it and found another dress but just at that moment on that day...	0 
That's good. Time heals all wounds and can be a powerful cure to pain and disdain.	0 
Indeed.  I had to take a reality check.  Afterall the day wasnt about me_comma_ it was about the bride and groom lol.	1 
I never can get myself to give away their baby items. 	0 
You are telling me you are a hoarder?	0 
lol no I just can't part with items that mean a lot to me like my kids baby things like first shirts ect.	0 
Everyone is nostalgic one way or another.You are fine	1 
I was walking down the street yesterday in my brand new summer dress.  I though i was gorgeous! Suddenly a big gust of wind came and blew my dress up around my ears! Where I succeeded in flashing my underwear to the entire street.  Oh the embarrassment.	0 
Oh my goodness! Thats terrible. Did anyone see? My face would be bright red.	0 
Oh my face was very red indeed and yes unfortunately I got a hugh cheer from a group of lads who witnessed it all.  I was so mortified I just ran home.  Later though I chatted about it with my friends and was finally able to laugh about it.	0 
I'm sure this will be one of those times where you cringe when you think back on it! I'm sure you made those guy's days though	0 
haha thats how I am trying to look at it.  Trying to see the funny side.  I have learnt my lesson about that dress though.  I think i will just put it back in the wardrobe and leave it there!	1 
I so get how you feel because I decided to watch Insidious the other night on my own.  I scared the life out of myself afterwards because I thought I kept seeing shadows and hearing noises and had myself convinced someone or something was in the house with me!	0 
That's crazy! I'm glad there was nothing there.	0 
Oh no just my vivid imagination lol.  I do love a good horror but usually I watch them with my husband.  I am clearly not as brave on my own!!	0 
Some horror movies are so great that they make you consider your own environment.	0 
You are right there.  Nothing better than a good film in general but horrors can really evoke such reactions from them.	1 
I helped a doctor's assistant over a couple of months	0 
That's great. I bet it was wonderful experience.	0 
It was she wasn't really good ans i had no problem helping	0 
That's cool. Taking that experience into the next phase will be pivotal.	0 
Yes!! They didn't forget me at Christmas 	1 
my car had a small accident recently	0 
I am sorry to hear that.Did you get hurt.	0 
no it was a minor accident _comma_ but car got damaged little	0 
Do you have full cover?	0 
yes _comma_ but when i went for claim insurance company terms made me feel helpless.	1 
I never did find out why there were so many police cars there today.	0 
Where did this happen?! Were there any other people with you?	0 
In town_comma_ I had my kids with me to buy school supplies.	0 
Did it happen while you were in the store? I hope that your kids did not see anything too disturbing.	1 
I found my old high school yearbooks that other day. 	0 
Oh that is pretty cool. What did you think?	0 
I think that I didn't appreciate not having to worry about adult stuff back then! 	0 
Yeah_comma_ we were blissfully unaware of the real world in those days. It must have been nice to reminisce.	0 
It was. It was also crazy to see the 1980s hairstyles. So.much.hairspray.	1 
I am feel pretty mucky things have been pretty stable at home.	0 
That has got to feel good!  You must feel very happy and relaxed!	0 
Yes I am and thankful since I have 3 young kids at home_comma_ 	0 
Cherish this time you have_comma_ because you never know when it could change!	1 
I got a gift card to a restaurant I've been wanting to try for a long time. 	0 
What restaurant is it for? 	0 
It's a local non-chain Greek restaurant. It's fancy and supposed to be very good. 	0 
Sounds good. I love mom n pop restaurants. So much better than big popular restaurants.	0 
Yes. Almost always better!	1 
I went on a blind date last week. Honestly_comma_ I didn't know what to expect at first.	0 
That sounds really interesting. Were there any good matches?	0 
It was alright_comma_ but it was hard to find common ground at first.	0 
Well at least you are putting yourself out there. A lot of people give up on finding love.	1 
I have a dentist appointment tomorrow. I think I have a cavity.	0 
Oh no_comma_ I hate cavities. Are you brushing your teeth eVeryday?	0 
Yes_comma_ but I think I'm genetically hosed when it comes to teeth. I really hate it. 	0 
Dang_comma_ that sucks. I hope you can find a solution for that	1 
My son scored a perfect 1600 on the SATs!!	0 
Wow_comma_ you must be proud! He might cure cancer next!	0 
I am proud. And he may eventually cure cancer_comma_ but I'd settle right now for him cleaning his room!	0 
Geniuses don't do chores my friend.	1 
I went to my moms funeral yesterday_comma_ but surprisingly I wasn't sad at all. I was at peace because she accomplished a lot during her time here on earth.	0 
I'm so sorry to hear about your mom. It's good that you're at peace with it_comma_ though. 	0 
Yeah_comma_ she's in a better place now.	0 
But a part of her is still here in you. 	1 
My husband and sons left town for weekend. 	0 
They left you all alone? I bet you feel lonely...	0 
Yeah_comma_ it was cool for a while_comma_ but the house is way to quiet now	0 
I know that feeling. I like to keep the TV on to drown out the silence	1 
So_comma_ I bought myself a box strawberry frosted pop tarts last week. Today I went to go have one for breakfast...GONE! 	0 
Whoever ate it all is evil!!!	0 
I need to interrogate everyone in this house. I'm so angry. You don't mess with Mom's Pop Tarts!	0 
I know right. I would be so furious!	1 
My neighbor was having a party last night and wouldn't let me sleep. I felt like going out there and giving him a piece of my mind!	0 
I would do it! Try to be calm about it at first and see how he responds.	0 
No_comma_ next time I might snap. They never show any consideration for anybody on the block. They do whatever they want.	0 
Yeah_comma_ something should be done about it!	1 
My friend wanted to go to lunch today. I told her I was busy_comma_ but really I just didn't want to go...	0 
I've done that before when I was just annoyed with them. Don't feel bad!	0 
Well_comma_ I do feel a little guilty_comma_ just sitting here on my couch watching tv	0 
Who cares! I always like to think of satisfying myself first before others!	1 
So...the sewer line backed up into our house last week. 	0 
Oh no! That's a smelly situation to be in. What did you end up doing to fix it?	0 
It was truly disgusting. We had to have a crew of plumbers come in and dig up our yard.	0 
What a pain! I bet that cost a fortune. Did they end up repairing all the portions of yard that they had to rip up?	1 
My brother got out of prison yesterday! It felt so good to see him after such a long time.	0 
That must have been a great reunion! Who was happier_comma_ him or you?	0 
Definitely me_comma_ I gave him a big bear hug when he walked out those gates.	0 
He was lucky to have you waiting there for him!	1 
The transmission in my car died last week. Such an expensive repair	0 
Ugh_comma_ I hate when unexpected expenses arise.	0 
Fortunately_comma_ my parents offered to loan me the money to fix it. 	0 
Well_comma_ that was nice of them. I hope you take them out to dinner after you pay them back.	1 
My friend and I both did a low-carb diet last month. She lost 8 pounds. I gained 2! 	0 
Wow_comma_ great for her! I am confused as to how you ended up GAINING though!	0 
I dunno. Water weight? She looks so good now. I'm really envious. 	0 
Well_comma_ keep at it and you will get where you want to be. It really just comes down to how many calories you take in vs. how many calories you burn per day.	1 
On a whim today_comma_ I bought a scratch off card at 7/11	0 
Please tell me you won a lot of money.	0 
Not a lot - $100. But that's $100 more than I had when I woke up this morning. I was so surprised I did one of those annoying girly squeals at the check out counter	0 
lol That's how I would of reacted too. One hundred dollars can buy you a lot of stuff.	1 
My kids spilled juice on my brand new white carpet. I told them not to brink food_comma_ or drinks in the living room. When will they learn?	0 
OH NO! That's infuriating. Did the stain come out?	0 
Yes_comma_ but I had to spend extra money to get the carpet shampooed. I gave them a spanking that they will never forget. I'm not putting up with this no more.	0 
Hopefully they remember	1 
I had a salad for lunch yesterday_comma_ then went shopping at the mall. When I got home around 7pm I discovered I had a HUGE piece of spinach between my front teeth!	0 
Did you brush it right out?	0 
I did. But dozen of people had already seen it. I was mortified. No one told me!	0 
Maybe you could give them a call on the phone and tell them about your feelings?	1 
My friend invited me to a pool party_comma_ but I don't know how to swim. I told her I would think about it.	0 
You could go to the party. And then learn how to swim!	0 
I'm not sure_comma_ I might just stay in the shallow part of the pool.	0 
Yea_comma_ and you can bring some water toys to play with!	1 
I went to a wedding this weekend. I've recently lost a ton of weight so I bought a new dress for the occassion. 	0 
Awesome! I bet you felt proud at what you accomplished. Did you have this goal in mind for a while?	0 
Yes. I've wanted to be healthier_comma_ but I also wanted to look hot and feel confident at this event. 	0 
How much total weight did you lose_comma_ and how long did it take?	1 
I'm leaving for vacation on Wednesday!	0 
Thats awesome.  I wish I could go.  Where are you going?	0 
On a cruise to Havana. I'm so excited!	0 
Cruises are awesome.  You get to eat as much food as you want.  You'll probably put on like 10 pounds	1 
I got caught in a huge rainstorm last week. It was a deludge. 	0 
Aww man_comma_ I hope you brought your raincoat.	0 
Thankfully I had remembered to put an umbrella in my bag before I left the house. 	0 
That's good_comma_ you don't want to get soaked and catch a cold.	1 
My brother in the army showed up at my football event yesterday. I wasn't expecting him to come. I thought he was still stationed in Iraq.	0 
That's amazing. You must have been so surprised and happy!	0 
Totally_comma_ I was in shock.	0 
Did you get a video of it?	1 
Once_comma_ at a Waffle House near Memphis_comma_ I heard a man order 15 eggs over-easy. 	0 
Gee_comma_ he must have been really hungry! That's a lot of eggs!	0 
I stayed to watch to see if he'd eat them all. He did. I was very impressed.	0 
Wow.. that's unbelievable. I wonder how his cholesterol is. 	1 
TSA made me pull down my pants in front of everybody at the airport yesterday. They thought I was a bomb threat.	0 
Oh dang_comma_ that really sucks. I can't believe TSA would go that far_comma_ it must've been super embarrassing. 	0 
Yeah_comma_ I will never show my face there again.	0 
Dude_comma_ you should definitely report it someone or the company because you could probably get something out of it.	1 
I rode the largest roller coaster I've ever ridden this summer. 	0 
Oh yeah_comma_ what was it called? I really love roller coasters!	0 
Millenium Force_comma_ in Cedar Point. It was utterly terrifying. 	0 
I saw that one on TV. It looks absolutely nuts. I hope to visit Cedar Point one day!	1 
I'm waiting to hear back from a few colleges about scholarships.	0 
Oh_comma_ I hope you get some good news. I am sure it would help you getting aid for college.	0 
Yes_comma_ I think my stats are good. I'm hopeful there will be some good news soon.	0 
All you can do is be patient and see what happens. I am sure everything will work out for you.	1 
My best friend is getting married next weekend. I'm in the wedding. 	0 
That's awesome. I hope it works out for your friend and their fiancee. Are you excited to be there?	0 
Super excited! These two have been together forever. It's about time they made it legit!	0 
Well I am sure they appreciate you being a part of their big day. Enjoy the after party!	1 
I went to a fancy art showing at a gallery last night.	0 
Wow_comma_ that sounds fun. What type of artwork did you see?	0 
It was watercolors. My neighbor was the artist. I had no idea she did such great work. She also has two toddlers. I have no idea how she manages all of that.	0 
Gee_comma_ she must have her hands full! I hope she does well as an artist!	1 
I thought I could lift_comma_ but my wife upstaged me by benching 150 lbs at the gym the other day. I can only lift 130 lbs.	0 
Did you feel very emasculated by this?	0 
No_comma_ it actually turned me on. I didn't know she was that strong.	0 
Yeah_comma_ I can see that viewpoint as well. She may end up carrying you to bed next time!	1 
My son came back from a camping trip last night. I was great to have him safely home again. 	0 
I'm glad he returned home safe and sound. Did he have fun on the camping trip?	0 
He did. I'm a worrier_comma_ but I need to learn to let go more. 	0 
My mom was the same way. It's all part of being a parent. I hope to have kids soon too and I worry about stuff concerning them myself!	1 
I came across my wedding albums the other day and showed them to my kids.	0 
Oh wow_comma_ I bet the emotions of that came back to you.	0 
Yes_comma_ it was so much fun to see the younger version of me and my husband_comma_ pre-kids. Very sentimental.	0 
Yes_comma_ those memories are what make life so special.	1 
I got a car for my birthday_comma_ but I kinda knew I was going to get it beforehand because I kept telling my wife I wanted it.	0 
So_comma_ not a surprise_comma_ but still nice to get? 	0 
Yeah_comma_ kind of ruined the surprise_comma_ but I can always count on my wife to make me feel special.	0 
That's sweet. 	1 
I donated $1_comma_000 to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. It's for a great cause that's very important to me.	0 
Wow_comma_ thats very admirable of you.  People who abuse animals are the worst kind of people.	0 
I agree_comma_ we should protect and nurture animals_comma_ not abuse them. 	0 
I have 2 dogs myself and I could never imagine hurting them.  I can't believe there are people out there who think that that is ok. its sick.	1 
i miss my childhood and living with my parents	0 
Yeah those were the days. When we had no worries in the world.	0 
yes indeed.  i wish i had my treehouse back that my dad built for me.  i would live in it.	0 
That sounds really cool. I always wanted a treehouse but never had a good tree for it.	0 
i grew up in the country_comma_ it was a great place to grow up.	1 
i live next to a football field and every football season i hate living here	0 
Oh yeah_comma_ why is that?	0 
Because they park in my driveway!	0 
I would have them towed!	0 
i have signs up this year_comma_ so i can do that legally!	0 
Oh so you have to have a sign up to legally tow them?	0 
Yes. Which i think is wrong.  If they are on my property i should have the right without the sign.	0 
Or you could just park behind them so that they would have to knock on your door before you let them out.	1 
my husband treated me to a week at disney_comma_ i had no idea!	0 
That's awesome. Which Disney park did you go to?	0 
disney world. it's the only one Ive ever been to .	0

My daughter went out of town_comma_ but she promised me she wouldn't do anything I wouldn't approve of_comma_ and I believe her_comma_ so I let her go.	0 
that's great that you can trust her.  how old?	0 
Yeah_comma_ she's a good kid and hasn't given me any reason to think otherwise. She just turned 18.	0 
That's great. Be thankful_comma_ some people aren't so lucky.	1 
Man I can't believe I almost bought that thing at Walmart!	0 
what did you almost buy?	0 
It was a combination rice-cooker and vegetable steamer.  It looked so good in the ad_comma_ but when I got there_comma_ it looked cheap and shabby!	0 
It's hard to find good quality at walmart	0 
I hope I can find one that lives up to the promise of that ad.  Maybe somwhere else_comma_ right?	0 
I would try target.  good quality stuff there.	0 
I could try online_comma_ but I'd have to buy it first and then see if it's good quality.	0 
try googling it_comma_ and read thru the reviews	1 
i am trying to sell my house_comma_ i hope i can find a buyer	0 
Finding a buyer can be tough.  You have a good agent?	0 
I hope i do.  We will see_comma_ I know it can take a while.\	0 
Does it have a good location?  You know the only rule of real estate_comma_ right?  Location_comma_ Location_comma_ Location.	0 
yes i live behind a school.	0 
Sounds good.  Definitely should target a family buyer then	0 
yes_comma_ but i will leave that to the listing agent.	0 
You got a figure in mind for your house or are you letting the agent handle that as well?	1 
I had to leave my last job because this manager they brought in was such an incompetent doofus.	0 
Thats never good when you have a bad manager.  What made them so bad?	0 
He was the "marketing manager" but couldn't market his way out of a paper bag_comma_ it was impossible to work with him. Plus he thought he knew everything which made it worse.	0 
Know it alls are the worst.  Hopefully you are in a better spot now_comma_ with a manager who cares.	0 
I am actually_comma_ thank you for caring!	1 
i am concerned about my father	0 
Oh no! What's wrong with your dad?	0 
he is old_comma_ and he lives alone.  i just worry because he is getting old.  he gets on ok_comma_ but i don't know how much longer.	0 
Aw_comma_ I'm so sorry to hear that. It's not easy to watch our parents age. 	0 
no it's not_comma_ but hopefully our kids will do the same for us some day.	0 
We can surely hope! 	1 
My neighbor asked me to watch over his dog. I told him he could trust me_comma_ but he escaped and ran away.	0 
That must have made you feel terrible. Were you able to find the dog?	0 
I feel so bad. I forgot to lock the gate. No_comma_ but I put up a lot of posters_comma_ so hopefully I find him before my neighbor comes back.	0 
I sincerely hope you can find him! But I bet your neighbor will understand it was just a mistake and you didn't do it on purpose.	1 
I used to have this obnoxious neighbor who stayed up all night playing League of Legends_comma_ he drove me nuts screaming into his headset all hours of the day and night.	0 
Doesn't he understand that people have to go to work in the morning?	0 
His parents paid his bills so no_comma_ he didn't understand that sadly. I tried talking to him about it but clearly he didn't get the picture as he kept doing it.	0 
You might have to file a noise complaint with the police.	1 
i have a new job offer_comma_ but im not sure if i should take it	0 
What is causing you to question whether it's the right thing for you or not?	0 
well_comma_ it is retail.  ive done retail and it is not fun.	0 
Yeah_comma_ I've done that as well.  It can definitely be a hard job_comma_ considering dealing with the public_comma_ hours during holiday seasons_comma_ etc.. But sometimes if the pay is good_comma_ it can outweigh some of the negatives.	0 
that's true. i don't like dealing with people.	1 
So this one time I walked in on my cat using the toilet by himself. He just taught himself to do it_comma_ I had no idea how or why but it was pretty cool.	0 
lol that remind me of a movie i saw with robert deniro _comma_ thats absolutly bizzare by the way but cool at the same time	0 
I know which movie you're talking about! I think they actually had to train that cat to do it. Mine just... learned.	0 
wow _comma_ i would love to have a cat like yours 	1 
I went to a concert by myself because all my friends were too busy doing other things.	0 
Aww thats too bad that no one else could go.  What concert was it?	0 
It was a Marilyn Manson concert. I was even dancing by myself.	0 
haha that must have been a crazy concert! 	1 
This friend of mine is constantly job hopping_comma_ I don't even know what she does technically but she seems to get good jobs so easily_comma_ whereas when I left my last job I could barely get interviews.	0 
Sometimes that depends on the industry. If she works in ones that have high turnover it's not a big of a deal as_comma_ say_comma_ an administrative job	0 
She's in banking so there are definitely a lot of available jobs. And there seems to be a lot of turnover so you're probably right.	0 
Well_comma_ I'm not entirely sure about the banking side but I wonder what she's looking for. Perhaps a small vs big bank culture	1 
I am ready to start renovating the rest of my house.	0 
OOO I love doing that_comma_ but not so much the upheaval in the midst of it.  What room are you going to be working on?	0 
I finished my kitchen_comma_ so the next room is going to be my family room.  Just painting it really. 	0 
Still_comma_ a new color can definitely brighten up a space and make it feel all new!	0 
Oh yes_comma_ we haven't decided on the color yet.	1 
This morning I woke up and I was in such a good mood that I just started singing in the shower.	0 
That's awesome!  I wish I could wake up that way every morning.  Did something specific make you feel that way?	0 
I don't know_comma_ I think it was because I had a dream about marrying Scarlett Johansson.	0 
Ha!!  Well I've woken up from a dream and been mad at my husband because of something he did in my dream - I guess it can go the other way too!	1 
I went through my closet the other day and found all these old writings and drawings I did when I was in elementary school. It was fun remembering being that little_comma_ how different the world was.	0 
I've done that before... I enjoyed it too! I love looking back at old pictures and stuff	0 
Did your parents save a lot of your school work like mine did? I'm surprised how much my mom kept!	0 
Some of it but my grandma did save a lot.  I plan on doing that with my kids	1 
For my birthday last year_comma_ a coworker gave me cheese. It sounds ridiculous but I was touched by her thoughtfulness. I love cheese!	0 
I love cheese too! What kind of cheese was it?	0 
Smoked gouda_comma_ one of my favorites! I ate it all in a day haha	0 
Gouda is great! Do you like prosciutto too?	0 
YES. Basically anything meat and cheese and I am totally there!	1 
My cat had really bad breath so I took her in to the dentist. It turned out almost all of her teeth needed to be pulled_comma_ poor thing was in so much pain.	0 
Aww poor baby_comma_ hopefully shes doing fine now.	0 
She's doing great_comma_ thanks! It was a tough recovery for a few days but then you could tell she felt SO much better.	0 
That's great to hear. You have one tough cat.	1 
When I was a kid_comma_ I remember telling my mom to take me to McDonald's_comma_ just so I could get the toy in my Happy Meal. I didn't even care about the food.	0 
Ha_comma_ I used to do that too. But I was almost always disappointed by the toy once I actually got it.	0 
Right? but when you collected them all there was no greater feeling.	0 
True! McDonald's was my first job when I was 14 and I remember being stoked I could now collect ALL the toys even if I didn't play with them!	1 
I'm so nervous. I had a job interview the other day and haven't heard back yet.	0 
Did they tell you when you may hear back from them?	0 
They said within the week_comma_ I know it's only been a few days but I'm excited about the opportunity!	0 
I pray they get in touch with you soon and that's is an affirmative on the job!  I know  how nerve-wracking waiting can be though - I hope you get it!	1 
Unfortunately_comma_ I accidentally sent an email to a coworker essentially complaining about her attitude. I really wanted to dig myself in a hole and never come out.	0 
Arghhhhhhhhh! I soooo feel for you and have been there. Have y'all had the chance to talk about it? (Or do you even want to?)	0 
I've kind of avoided her a bit. I'm trying to come up with an apology that feels heartfelt. It's a horrible feeling!	0 
I hear you. Maybe humor might help? Like "okay_comma_ so *this* is awkward....can we talk about that email?" Heartfelt apologies go a long way_comma_ and even if she doesn't respond -- you'll feel better for trying.	1 
I went to a restaurant and the waitress put things on our bill that I did not order. 	0 
Are you sure they didnt bring the wrong bill?	0 
It had everything we ordered plus a couple things at the bottom we didn't order.	0 
I would have complained.	0 
Oh_comma_ I did_comma_ she immediately said ok I'll take it off like it happened all the time. Made me think it was done on purpose just to see if I  wouldn't notice.	1 
Since most of my family is either dead or lives a few states away_comma_ I usually spend Thanksgiving alone. It sucks sometimes.	0 
Ohh_comma_ I feel sorry for you	0 
Oh don't feel bad_comma_ I live a lovely life and have many friends. It's just that they usually go home to their own families that time of year.	0 
Ohh_comma_ that's bad. You can always skype your family!	1 
I spent the entire other weekend cleaning my apartment. It sucked at the time but it was so nice when I was done to just chill out and watch TV.	0 
Yes_comma_ I feel you. Cleaning sucks_comma_ but after all that hard work_comma_ the results are amazing!	0 
Right? It's so rewarding when you're finished and everything smells good. I love that feeling.	0 
Me too! You seem just like me!	1 
My husband and I closed on our first house last week!	0 
That sounds very exciting! What kind of planning did you put into such an achievement?	0 
It is! Lots of blood_comma_ sweat and tears - and lots of phone calls and signing things_comma_ haha. We can't wait to move in!	0 
That's so cool! I wish you the very best and hope that the blood sweat and tears turns into happiness_comma_ joy and fun times!	1 
my daughter moved to California and a few months later she got in a car accident and was on the other side of the country so there was nothing I could immediately do.	0 
Are there any other family members out there that could help her?	0 
No. She asked her friend to call me after it happened but wasn't able to tell me many details.	0 
Wow_comma_ I hope that she was able to work things out. Not the best way to start living somewhere far from home_comma_ but I'm sure she figured something out.	0 
They took her to the hospital for evaluation but she ended up just being a bit bruised up. I was worried something like this would happen. Everything did work out in the end though.	1 
Recently I was contacted by my former company_comma_ begging to get me back. I felt really good about the salary negotiation since I knew they needed me.	0 
That's great! I am happy for you!	0 
Thanks_comma_ I'm happy about it. I only have to work a few hours a week_comma_ it's pretty amazing.	0 
Yeah_comma_ and they are paying you good enough. You are a luckiest person!	1 
i was shocked to learn that i had been called to serve on a jury !	0 
i honestly have never gone to jury duty _comma_ but im sure it was still a pain to put it on your schedule 	0 
yes i am not looking forward to it.  ive heard that its just awful.	0 
same thing i heard too _comma_ really long and boring being there against your will 	0 
yes i think it is going to be a long week or so.	1 
My dog died this past December and I've had a really hard time getting over it. She was our family pet.	0 
I am so sorry to hear that. I have been devastated by the loss of pets in the past_comma_ so I can understand what you're going through. I'm sure she was very loved and had a great life with you and your family.	0 
She really was a wonderful pet. We just got a puppy recently_comma_ which is the same breed as the one who passed away. She's bringing some light back into our lives. 	0 
Aww that's great! What breed? 	1 
The worst day of my life was when I was 8 months pregnant with our first child and I started bleeding like crazy.	0 
Oh no! that sounds so scary. was everything ok?	0 
Yes_comma_ thankfully everything turned out fine. I had to spend 3 weeks in the hospital though!	0 
Good I'm glad to hear that.  That's a long time.  Hospitals scare me_comma_ I can't imagine being there for that long	1 
my doggie recently passed away	0 
I'm so sorry to hear that! Hopefully he or she wasn't in too much pain at the end.	0 
no i don't think so_comma_ but it was violent.  she was run over by a car.  	0 
Oh my gosh that's horrible. I hope they caught the person who hit her!	0 
i don't think i will ever know. they usually don't stop when that happens.	1 
The other day I woke up and without looking I stepped in warm cat vomit.	0 
oh man_comma_ that's gross! at least it was vomit and not something else.	0 
Yeah it was pretty gross but one of my cats is pretty pukey_comma_ I should have known better and watched where I was walking.	0 
how many cats do have?	0 
Well right now I have six but they're not all mine_comma_ I foster for a cat rescue. Three are mine_comma_ three are for adoption. It gets crazy in my house!	1 
My dog died last year. 	0 
Aw_comma_ I am so sorry. How long did you have your dog for?	0 
About 5 years. He was a rescue.	0 
They say dogs are mans best friend. 	0 
That's true. He was definitely mine.	0 
What kind of dog was he?	0 
He was a pit and lab mix.	0 
Nice_comma_ I have an australian shepherd. He follows me around everywhere. 	1 
The worst phone call I ever got in my life was when I was told my dad only had a few weeks left to live.	0 
Oh no. That's terrible. I lost my dad five years ago_comma_ I know how terrible that feels.	0 
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm going on just over two years. Never thought it would happen to us.	0 
Neither did we. He seemed so healthy_comma_ and then within weeks he was so sick he couldn't even talk. I miss him every day_comma_	0 
They will live on in our love and memories. I hope the heaviness lessens one day at a time <3	1 
The other day I checked my email and a former client I did some freelance work had emailed me a gift card out of the blue! I was happy.	0 
surprise gifts are always fun.	0 
Very! I decided since it was surprise money I would waste it on something fun.	0 
that sounds like a well deserved plan.	1 
I remember the first I went to a theme park.  I had been planning on the way there not to go on any roller coasters_comma_ but just being there changed my mind quickly.	0 
Oh man_comma_ I can relate_comma_ that feeling of anxiety before you get there really turns around when you get caught up in the moment	0 
Exactly.  I just saw how much fun it looked and I thought to myself I should just live a little.  It's not often you get to have experiences like that.	0 
Life is full of experiences like that_comma_ they seem scary from the outside_comma_ but once you relax you get swept away	1 
i lost $100 cash somewhere. I have looked everywhere and i can't find it	0 
that sounds prettty bad!	0 
yes_comma_ i have retraced my steps and i can't find it.  hopefully i will find it when i need it the most.	0 
I cannot imagine if something like that happens to me. I would be trying very hard to find it.	0 
i have looked everywhere. it's so frustrating.	0 
Sometimes by remembering all the places that you have been in the past two days can help. I will try that!	1 
I really hate when people let their kids run wild in public. I do believe kids should be kids but there is a time and place for it.	0 
I agree completely it is an embarrassment to the parents you would think. 	0 
The worst is when they're screaming at them rather than just speaking to them calmly. 	0 
The frustration they go through well at least we don't have to take the kids or parents home.	1 
I wanted to go and get the tissue that was on sale was so bummed it was sold out.	0 
What store were you at? 	0 
I was going to Walgreen's and they was out and the sale began today. 	0 
Could you get a rain check? That is a bummer? 	0 
It get's worse no rain check but they insist on giving me customer service number to still receive points towards my card.	1 
it was my birthday and felt like no one really cared 	0 
Aw man_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better? 	0 
thanks! my coworker went out on lunch break and bought my favorite ice cream cake!	0 
Ice cream cake is my favorite! I'm glad you're feeling better haha. You have a really nice co-worker.	0 
yes she is honestly the greatest 	0 
That's really awesome! She sounds like a great person to work with.	1 
I completely ate the last cupcake even though I know my husband will want one when he gets home. Should I go get some more?	0 
Oh_comma_ I know how that goes. My husband loves sweets_comma_ but if it is just sitting there and no one is eating it It will get eaten right then. Getting another would depend on how much he likes sweets and needs them. lol	0 
Right! It's almost like_comma_ you knew this was going to happen. I feel terrible but it was so good lol. I'll get him some more tomorrow!	0 
That's probably what I would do also. It won't kill him to wait another day.	1 
I was at the store the other day and the lady ahead of me had no idea how to use self checkout_comma_ I wish she would have used the regular line instead of holding everyone up.	0 
Oh I hate when that happens. we go to self checkout to avoid things like slow lines.	0 
Exactly! I wasn't in a hurry or anything but it felt so inconsiderate.	0 
Hopefully the person learned what they had to do so they don't hold the line up in the future.	0 
We can only hope.	1 
When I was in high school there was a girl I had liked for a long time that ended up dating my best friend.	0 
Oh man_comma_ that must have hurt. Did she know you had feelings for her?	0 
Yes. But at the time she was unavailable. Then when she wasn't spoken for my "friend" asked her out.	0 
Sounds like your friend broke bro code_comma_ that was kind of scummy.	1 
I had mentioned to my friend one day that my computer was pretty much on its way out.  Some time later I found that he had sent me the money to buy a new one.	0 
Wow! What a nice friend. I wish my friends did that	0 
Yea I was really thankful and appreciative for it.  He's like a brother to me.	0 
That's great. It's nice to have people so close to you. It really helps in bad times	0 
It really does.  I think when it comes to friends quality is better than quantity.  I like to have friends that feel like family.	1 
I cried so hard seeing my baby girl walk across the stage at her VPK graduation.	0 
That must of been a proud moment for you as a father.  She's all grown up and out in the real world now	0 
Yes this is a new milestone and now she get's to see what real school is all about with all age groups.	0 
That's awesome_comma_ she'll have a great time and learn a lot i'm sure!	1 
I entered a raffle at a local fair and actually won $1000.	0 
Wow! What are you gonna do with the winnings?	0 
Oh they are long gone_comma_lol. Bills to pay and all.	0 
Bills do take up a lot_comma_ don't they.	0 
They sure do. The raffle did allow me to get ahead of things for a while though.	1 
One time I moved into a new apartment_comma_ it was this big loft in a converted warehouse. I had this automatic soap dispenser that went nuts on me and made this really scary sound_comma_ I thought the place was haunted!	0 
Oh my gosh! thats funny.  was that the only thing that made you think it was haunted?	0 
Haha yeah it was pretty funny once I realized what the spooky sound coming from the kitchen was.	0 
How did you discover exactly what it was?	0 
I turned off the TV and my phone and tried to trace the sound to its source. I feel ridiculous about it now in hindsight!	1 
I have a fear for roller coaster but I let my siblings talk me into getting on one last night.	0 
Roller coasters are scary for me. How was it for you?	0 
Fun but scary I couldn't wait for it to end lol had my eyes closed most of the ride. 	0 
I'm the same way haha. But how was it fun if you have your eyes closed the whole time?!	0 
My hands was up and feeling the wind in my face and facing my fears but I kept them closed because I just couldn't look because of the height lol. 	1 
I had to put my cat down a few years ago_comma_ she was old and in kidney failure.	0 
I am so sorry to hear that. I'm sure she was very happy while she was alive with you guys.	0 
She had a good life. She was actually my mom's cat_comma_ she came to live with me when my mom died.	0 
You went through a lot of losses.	1 
Someone buggy was in the way at Publix and I tripped and fell in the aisle. 	0 
That sounds painful_comma_ I hope you were okay after your fall. 	0 
I was ok just the look on m face let you know I was ashamed lol I turned red instantly. 	0 
Yeah i bet that was really embarrassing_comma_ but I'm glad you're okay. 	1 
I applied for a job one time where I was one of 4 people being considered for it and had to wait a week to find out if I got it.	0 
Oh boy!  That's always a nail biter waiting to hear back and it seems like they love to take the full amount of time before they let you know. Did you get it?!!	0 
I did get it! If I was a praying kind of guy I would have done so every day. I was o nervous.	0 
Amazing! Congratulation! Prayer is always a good thing to do! That is so incredible.  Are you enjoying the job?	1 
I remember being younger and waiting on Christmas Day to unwrap presents.  There were a lot of things I wanted that year.	0 
I remember those times. Did you get what you wanted?	0 
Well I was really looking forward to the Super Nintendo.  It had just come out that year and everyone my age wanted one.	0 
The super nintendo is a classic. What is your favorite game?	0 
Yea_comma_ they tried to trick me and wrap a box of clothes the same size to make me think I didn't get it.  My favorite game has to be Earthbound.	1 
I fell off my bike the other day in front of a bunch of people. It was kind of humiliating.	0 
Oh no! I'm so sorry!  I would feel the same way but you just have to think...who cares what others think!  If they can't have compassion for an accident then something is wrong with them.  Did you get hurt?	0 
You're right_comma_ the other people probably hardly noticed. And no_comma_ thankfully I was OK! Unless you count the bruise on my ego.	0 
I bet they didn't.  I like to look at experiences as part of our journey and teaches us to have compassion for others in similar situations.  So glad you're alright! Hope you own a helmet!	0 
That's solid advice_comma_ thank you. And yes_comma_ I own a helmet_comma_ but admittedly don't wear it as often as I should. I will now!	1 
This one year right after I moved to the east coast we had this scary hurricane warning. I went ahead and stocked up on all the basics; batteries_comma_ canned goods_comma_ beer. I was set!	0 
How'd the hurricane go?	0 
Wouldn't you know it totally missed my city. I was a little let down to be honest_comma_ though glad we were safe.	0 
Thank goodness. Hurricanes are no joke.	1 
I was going on a trip and couldn't take my dog so I had to board him and I was so worried about it.	0 
Was he okay?	0 
He was fine. I just didn't know how he was going to handle it_comma_ he is a very nervous dog.	0 
Well maybe if you do it a little more then he will be fine with it. I would be afraid just because he is afraid.	0 
That's true. He was a rescue and sometimes I wonder if he was treated in a bad way and thats why he is like that.	0 
Maybe so. It's good he has a good home now.	0 
I like to think he does. I just hope he is as happy as he makes me.	0 
I bet he is. Don't worry	1 
I usually food prep for the week it is so much easier.	0 
That is a great idea	0 
Yes it works out great saves me money and keeps my scheduled arranged and on track. 	0 
Saving money is important	1 
My daughter graduated high school as a straight A student last year	0 
That's amazing! You must be so proud.	0 
Oh I am. It's nice to know that I raised a child with a good head on her shoulders.	0 
She's also a hard worker.	0 
I like to think so_comma_ although it seemed to alwasy be easy for her. 	1 
Yesterday my Lyft driver offered to carry my groceries up to my apartment. I thought that was super nice_comma_ there were A LOT of bags.	0 
That was very sweet they don't have to actually do that.	0 
It was sweet. And I told him not to worry about it_comma_ I didn't want to hold him up. 	0 
Good to know there is still kind people in the world.	1 
I got some pink roses at work last week I was so happy.	0 
That's awesome! Who were they from?	0 
My husband but I didn't expect it I was so surprised they was a just because gift.	0 
That was really sweet of him_comma_ maybe he just wanted you to know you're loved.	1 
I am about to leave on a 17 hour car trip with my husband_comma_ our four kids_comma_ and 2 dogs. I think I have everything ready to go though	0 
You can never be too prepared! I am sure you have got everything.	0 
I hope so. I even portioned out each meal for our dogs in little plastic bags to make sure we have enough. 	0 
That was very smart thinking on your part. Have fun on your trip!	1 
I sent an email I shouldn't have sent. I'd been drinking and totally should have saved it rather than sending it when I did.	0 
We all do things we regret when drinking	0 
True. The funny thing was I obsessed over it for days_comma_ worrying I made a mistake. And absolutely nothing happened! I worried for nothing.	0 
Thats usually how it goes	1 
A few years ago I decided to move cross-country. It was kind of terrifying taking a huge leap like that with no job and hardly knowing anyone here.	0 
You definitely took a leap of faith there. How'd it go?	0 
It definitely has had its ups and downs but overall I'm really glad I did it. I don't think I'll be doing it again any time soon that's for sure.	0 
hahaha I definitely admire your courage to have done that.	1 
I'm going back to school I am going to stick to my goal and don't stop until I get my degree.	0 
I wish you luck	0 
Thanks I am super excited I know I will have a great outcome I have goals to meet.	0 
I am sure you will meet them	1 
I spent my birthday last year alone. I expected my boyfriend to make plans but nope.	0 
That's disappointing. What happened? Did he just not do anything?	0 
Yeah_comma_ he acted like it was just a normal day_comma_ it was so weird. Maybe I'm getting too old to make a big deal out of birthdays anyway.	0 
I would have been disappointed_comma_ too. 	1 
I get so annoyed when it rains I had plans for a family cookout but it started thundering and lightening such a bummer. 	0 
Oh no that is a total bummer. It's especially common in the summer months.	0 
Yes it's the worse especially in Florida it's sunny one day and pouring down raining the next. 	0 
Oh right_comma_ I spent some time in Florida when I was younger and I remember it being so unpredictable. Just gotta keep an umbrella all the time lol.	1 
I went to a book release party yesterday.	0 
Cool. Was it interesting?	0 
Yes. It was a good friend of mine. She got a novel published! She also has four small kids. I'm not sure how she does it all.	0 
Good for her! Moms get a lot done lol	1 
My best friend is moving across the country next week. 	0 
ARe you happy or sad?	0 
Sad. I will miss her terribly 	0 
I bet. I she moving school or a job?	1 
My job recognized me for my hard work I was thankful and surprised I just love my job.	0 
Oh cool that's great! What were you doing that they recognised?	0 
For over exceeding and helping all staff when in need_comma_ I am always just helpful but was happy to get noticed for my hard work.	0 
Awesome. What is your job?	0 
I work for the state we help clients with disabilities find employment it is case management work.	1 
I got a random email this morning with a $120 gift voucher	0 
Wow was it a scam or was it legit?	0 
I was really sure it was a scam but it turned out it was a prize for a survey I had submitted a few weeks ago!	0 
That is so good congratulations you are lucky what are you going to use it for?	0 
Thanks! No idea actually_comma_ it's for a department store here in Australia so will have to look around	1 
There was an "incident" at the gym today.	0 
Oh no_comma_ what happened?	0 
I finished a fabulous workout_comma_ then promptly fell UP the stairs on my way to the locker room. In front of everyone. I was mortified.	0 
Oh no! But that happens (it has happened to me several times). At least you had the great workout!	1 
After four long_comma_ broke months of looking_comma_ I finally got offered a job today!	0 
That's great. Are you excited?	0 
Yes_comma_ and incredibly happy. I was getting really worried about the bills. 	0 
Is it your dream job? Then you should really be happy.	1 
I had an email telling me I had a $120 gift voucher this morning	0 
Was it real?	0 
Haha that was my first thought too. It actually was!	0 
That's awesome. What are you going to buy?	0 
Thanks! No idea actually_comma_ it's for a department store here in Australia	0 
Australia. I hope to go there some day	0 
You definitely should! It's a really cool place_comma_ but so hard to see everything because it's so big	0 
I bet_comma_ I will get there one day	1 
I knocked over a clothing display on the sidewalk outside of a boutique the other day when I was riding my bike. I should have gone back to pick it up but kept going.	0 
I've done the same thing before. I'm sure you weren't a bother	0 
I hope not. Now that you mention it I'm sure it happens all the time.	0 
Yeah and they really should be better about how they place their racks	1 
I was waiting for a while for a video game to come out.  When it finally did it wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be.	0 
That has happend to me too.	0 
I got my hopes up too much. I should wait for reviews to come out before I rush out and buy next time.	0 
You can always sell them if you buy discs. Cant do anything with a download though	0 
That's very true.  Which is why I prefer physical discs most of the time.	0 
We live and we learn lol	0 
Exactly.  Next time I'm waiting for prices to drop_comma_ months after launch.	1 
The other day I was listening to Spotify and put U2's Achtung Baby on. It reminds me of pre middle school days.	0 
I used to love that band	0 
Yeah they were great back in the day. I can't comment on their new stuff_comma_ I haven't listened to any of it in years.	0 
I have not either	1 
So the cable repair guy was supposed to show up between 8:30 and 12:30 on Friday. Guess when he showed up....	0 
Probably at 4 or 5! lol	0 
You got it. 5:00. WHY does this still happen? I wasted the whole day waiting. 	0 
No idea! I haven't had cable in so long! I would HATE that and they always over charge! Don't they have a rule that theres no service fee if they are late?	1 
I got a random email telling me I had won a gift card	0 
Was it real because I get those every day lol	0 
Haha yeah it actually turned out to be real! It was for $120	0 
I could do so much with $120. Im jealous lol	1 
We had a near-disaster at our house today.	0 
oh no! what happened?	0 
My older son called from the bathroom that we were out of toilet paper. It seemed...um...urgent....Fortunately_comma_ we had an emergency stash in the laundry room.	0 
ah_comma_ crisis averted! that could have been a lot worse	1 
We went to our favorite Italian restaurant for dinner tonight.	0 
Was it good? I hate when your favorite place disappoints.	0 
It was good! It always is. I had my "usual" pasta and just enough wine to feel relaxed_comma_ but not loopy. It was a good way to end a Sunday.	0 
That's great. Sundays are supposed to be breezy	1 
I didn't have a pen while returning a rental car to an unattended location	0 
Hm_comma_ that sounds interesting. I'm not really familiar with this kind of situation_comma_ since I've never had to rent a car. What exactly happened_comma_ or what did that mean?	0 
Yeah I was travelling in the US and they just had a drop box where you put the keys and a form in. Luckily I asked a stranger who was passing by and they gave me a really nice pen to keep	0 
Oh_comma_ so it was no big deal? At least you cared enough to stop someone and ask them about it. No harm_comma_ no foul.	1 
I recently got an email from my old company hinting that they wanted me back. It was kind of exciting_comma_ I really wanted it to work out.	0 
I bet that was a nice feeling	0 
It definitely was. The money is great and I get to set my own hours!	0 
That sounds perfect	1 
I have a dentist appointment first thing tomorrow morning. 	0 
The dentist makes me a bit nervous	0 
It makes me VERY nervous. I hate it. I'll probably barely sleep tonight because of it. 	0 
Well at least think about the fact that it's a good thing to go to the dentist!	1 
I got back from vacation last week and found a huge dent in my car. 	0 
That is awful_comma_ did the person who hit it leave a note or a call back number? 	0 
No. They just hit it and left the airport parking lot. I'm pretty incensed. 	0 
You should ask the airport people if they have any security footage of the parking lot_comma_ maybe they can track down the car.	1 
I went to the fanciest dinner party the other night. It was  eight amazing courses of food!	0 
What kind of food was there?	0 
Really intricate things - souffles and such. I was very impressed.	0 
It is nice that you enjoyed it.	1 
I saw a mouse run across my kitchen last night. I woke everyone up with my screaming.	0 
Oh man.  That would of startled me too.  What did you do after?	0 
Stood on the couch and screamed some more! I do not do rodents. I'm having my son handle it. I think he's putting out traps tonight.	0 
Well I can understand your nervousness.  I probably would be on guard as well	1 
My kitty that I had since she was a kitten passed away. She was only four years old.	0 
Oh that is tough.  It is hard when our pets pass away.	0 
It really is. She was the first pet that was really "mine". She brought a lot of happiness to my life!	0 
It is like losing a family member isn't it.  Well_comma_ just think of all the good times and be thankful.	1 
I had a test the other day and I'm pretty sure I aced it. I studied for like a week!	0 
That's great! I never really studied much so I could have done better on my tests	0 
Same here. I never had to study for high school but when I hit college_comma_ it was a wakeup call.	0 
Oh yes. But_comma_ I found that getting involved in clubs along with a major I liked actually allowed me to spend less time studying and more time learning for fun. It's a subtle_comma_ but important diffeence	1 
So all my friends went on vacation last week :(	0 
Judging by the :(_comma_ I'm assuming you didn't get to join them?	0 
Yeah_comma_ we were supposed to go but I couldn't get off work. I got to see all the pictures on Facebook though_comma_ ha! So envious.	0 
I would be envious too.  Perhaps next time you can go somewhere and return the feeling :D	0 
Sounds like a plan :)	0 
I hope where ever you go_comma_ you visit someplace amazing!	1 
Man I am stuffed.  I found a new pizza joint in town.	0 
That is nice. Do you like a lot pizza?	0 
Yeah I definitely like a lot of pizza.  This place had a all you can eat buffet.  I ate my fill of pizza!	0 
You are lucky.	0 
I made sure it was the only thing I ate all day.  I was pretty content.	1 
Man I couldn't get any sleep last night.	0 
Were you worried about something? What was keeping you up?	0 
There was something scratching on my window.  I was pretty nervous.	0 
Hopefully you had a lock on them_comma_ you can never be too safe.	0 
Well that's the thing.  when I looked out in the morning I didn't see anything.	1 
One year for our anniversary_comma_ an iPad showed up at my office. My boyfriend had ordered it and timed it so arrived on our exact anniversary. I didn't expect it at all!	0 
Dang really! Sounds like you have a boyfriend that likes to shower you with presents.	0 
He's generous yeah but I wouldn't call it "showering." He's just good about knowing what I need!	0 
That means that he is always listening and paying attention to you!	1 
I used to enjoy cold showers in the morining.	0 
I have never tried a cold shower? What is it like?	0 
It's very cold and refreshing_comma_ wakes you up instantly.	0 
I bet it does wake you up right away. I guess I should try that sometime if I oversleep. lol !	1 
My neighbor refuses to clean up after her dog and it's infuriating.	0 
wow that is very rude of her	0 
It really is. I'm not sure what to do though besides reporting her to the HOA. Any suggestion?	0 
No I have never dealt with a rude person like that that lives near me	0 
Lucky you! For some reason I seem to be attracted to apartments filled with rude people.	1 
What else do we need_comma_ just a sunny bench and some chips.	0 
I totally agree. That actually sounds really good rihgt now.	0 
So lets go_comma_ I'll meet you outside in an hour. 	0 
Sounds fun. Ill be ready. Hope were going to the beach thats closest to us!	1 
I am looking forward for tomorrow. 	0 
 I will be expecting to see you there.	0 
Yes_comma_ tomorrow as well as today are such a nice places. 	0 
Having positive attitude always succeed. Keep it up.	1 
I was walking around town yesterday and saw a girl with crazy hairstyle.	0 
Interesting.  What was the first thought that popped into your head when you witnessed this?	0 
It was...Dandelion. 	0 
Is that a reference to the color of the hair_comma_ the shape or something else?	1 
Man I felt good when I applied for my job!	0 
How did it go? That's an anxiety-inducing but hopeful situation!	0 
No I was very assured in my interview.  I got the job_comma_ probably because of my attitude.	0 
Congratulations! Enjoy the new gig! Good things happen to good people.	0 
I could definitely feel it going to other way if I was defeatist in my interview.	0 
Being defeatist is never a good move. Honestly_comma_ once you've got your foot in the door I think it's all about personality. 	0 
It can be_comma_ but personality can't make up for incomptence either.	0 
I would argue most good employers can diagnose incompetence from the first or second conversation. If they can't_comma_ maybe they aren't good employers.	1 
I flipped through my high school yearbooks the other day for the first time in a long time. I can't believe how much time has passed.	0 
Time does fly really fast. I just turned 30 and it feels like I was just a teenager yesterday!	0 
Enjoy it_comma_ your 30s go by really fast. I'm clinging desperately to the last few years of mine myself.	0 
I'm sure it will. At least it gets us to enjoy life more and focus on the moment.	1 
It's very strange when you meet somebody you know_comma_ in the middle of a megalopolis. 	0 
Yeah_comma_ it's like a small world.	0 
Exactly_comma_ how does it even work?	0 
I think it is merely a coincidence.	1 
Small thing in life used to make me shed tears.	0 
Indeed they can. Is there any specific moment that you would like to talk about?	0 
Yes_comma_ things like great classical music for example. 	0 
Oh_comma_ I see. I thought that some other bad things happening in your personal life are making you cry	1 
We have to stay positive through all the things that happen in the world. 	0 
I completely agree. We must have positive thoughts at all times. 	0 
Yes_comma_ that's a good start.	0 
Our thoughts are were everything starts. Mindset is so important. 	1 
Someone my husband used to work with got a promotion and a really big raise.	0 
That's awesome!  What do they do?	0 
They work in the oil field. My husband left the company they both worked for and I can't help but think if he still worked their he would have gotten a raise too.	0 
That would be nice_comma_ but it's never good to dwell on things like that instead of looking toward the future.	1 
Last week driving to work_comma_ I got pulled over for speeding.	0 
That sucks. How fast were you driving?	0 
Only a couple miles over. It's always a terrible thing to see those lights in your mirror.	0 
I hate getting pulled over too. Especailly for something silly like being a couple of miles an hour over the speed limit	1 
I haven't drank beer in almost a year_comma_ but yesterday I relapsed. I feel like such a loser.	0 
Oh man_comma_ I'm so sorry to hear that. You're not a loser though! Just take one day at a time. If you relapsed yesterday just move on and do your best not to drink today and tomorrow	0 
I just can't believe I gave in to the pressure. Oh well_comma_ yeah your right. I'll start by taking baby steps.	0 
Don't be so hard on yourself. We are all humans_comma_ we make mistakes. 	1 
My neighbor is remodeling his house_comma_ which I hate_comma_ because they start at 5:30 in the morning.	0 
That is probably so annoying	0 
I have a 3 year old_comma_ so he wakes up at 5:30 because of all the hammering going on.	0 
That really sucks. How long will it be going on?	1 
My wife told me she's pregnant the other day. I was baffled by the news because the doctor told us she only had a ten percent chance of having a baby.	0 
Wow.  That's either really lucky or unlucky_comma_ depending on what you want.  Are you wanting kids?	0 
Yeah_comma_ it just came at an unexpected time. I really want a little boy.	0 
Well_comma_ then congratulations!  I wish you the best of luck_comma_ and enjoy this time! :)	1 
I went to see a movie last night. I wasn't really able to enjoy it though.	0 
Why not?	0 
There was this couple sitting two rows in front of me.... they just wouldn't shut up.	0 
Oh man! That is why I watch movies at home. It's just more comfortable.	1 
I saw a psychiatrist for the first time yesterday. It was alright_comma_ but I have to admit I was a bit skeptical at first.	0 
I have considered it myself but feel the same as you. Will you go back again? 	0 
I might. It just makes me a little uneasy having to share personal information with a total stranger.	0 
right_comma_ i feel you but maybe it will be good to get it all out!! 	1 
My mom called me about a year ago and told me she had cancer.	0 
Is she doing okay now?	0 
Yes_comma_ she had a really difficult 6 months and then things started improving. 	0 
great_comma_ I am very glad to hear she is getting better!	1 
I was very pleased to get this job	0 
What is the job?	0 
I got the job has an software Analysis and that was aim	0 
Well congrats then_comma_ I am sure that is not easy	0 
A little bit. But when we doing it in a rightway from our heart really it will be easy 	1 
I was so angry_comma_ I threw a bottle of water!	0 
What caused that to happen?	0 
A server went down and I didn't get paid for my work :(	0 
Oh gosh_comma_ hopefully it doesnt happen next time	0 
Yeah I hope not_comma_ I can't afford work stoppages!	1 
i felt nostalgic looking through old photos today	0 
What were the photos of?	0 
just old family photos	0 
It is good to have those and look at once in awhile	1 
A couple months ago_comma_ my wife and I got divorced.	0 
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ what happened?	0 
We just grew apart I guess. House seems so empty with her and the kids gone.	0 
Did you try therapy at all or counseling?	1 
We can't afford to live in our home anymore	0 
Why is that?	0 
We're poor_comma_ and bills are adding up	0 
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ I hope things improve for you a ton!	0 
Thank you! I do as well	1 
Boy_comma_ it's been a lot of owrk	0 
Sometimes we believe is the things that happen to us ... they are many	0 
What sort of things?	0 
I interpret the difficulties	0 
What sort of difficulties/	0 
the lack of humor	0 
Ah_comma_ it's no joke is it	0 
Ok	1 
Last year_comma_ my father passed away.	0 
Oh goodness_comma_ I am so sorry to hear that. Was it sudden?	0 
Yeah_comma_ he developed a stage 4 glioma in his brain that could not be removed.	0 
That is awful and very sorry you had to go through that. I work at a cancer hospital so I can't imagine going through that with a loved one.	1 
i feel nostalgic going through old boxes in my basement	0 
What kind of stuff is in there?	0 
just old sports uniforms and toys and stuff like that	0 
Oh okay_comma_ I love going through my old stuff too_comma_ it is really fun	1 
I have plans so go to the beach with my wife for a week next month	0 
That sounds so fun!	0 
I cant wait! we have been looking forward to going back since our honeymoon.	0 
I hope you both have tons of fun!	0 
Thank you. We plan on it!	1 
I'm so glad my health is good	0 
that's great! I'm glad to hear that. we often take our health for granted.	0 
We do_comma_ and don't do enough to take care of it	0 
i'm one of those people. Eat junk food even though i know it's not good for me	0 
Ah_comma_ it'll catch up to you :(	1 
Oh man. I can't believe I made that mistake at work today.	0 
Uh OH what happened	0 
I was giving a presentation on the project that I'm working on_comma_ and I overlooked something simple.... one of my coworkers called me out on it. How embarrassing.	0 
Oh no_comma_ well mistakes do happen_comma_ it will be behind you in a few days	0 
I certainly hope so. The sooner everyone forgets about this_comma_ the better.	0 
Exactly good luck	0 
Thank you_comma_ I'm just glad it was at the end of the presentation so I was able to get out of there shortly after.	1 
I love to see old stuff from when I was a kid	0 
Oh yeah? What kind of old stuff?	0 
Old metal lunch boxes like Charlies Angels speed buggy ect	0 
I always liked those old lunch boxes myself. Do you have a favorite?	0 
Hong Kong Phooey lol	0 
Nice! I loved that show when I was a kid. I never had the lunch box though.	1 
It's time to move!	0 
Oh_comma_ OK!  WHere are you moving to?	0 
Another house_comma_ it's closer to school	0 
That's good!  That will make your life much easier!  Congratulations!	1 
So there's a girl that I've been talking to lately... I'm thinking about asking her out.	0 
That's exciting. Do you have a plan for a date for when she says yes?	0 
Yeah_comma_ I already have it all planned out. We get along really well_comma_ so I'm sure she's going to say yes.	0 
What all is on the agenda for the date?	0 
I'm going to take her to this restaurant she really likes_comma_ then go to a movie. I'm gonna show her a great time.	1 
I've finally finished writing the book that I've been working on for the last few months.	0 
Great. Are you going to get it published?	0 
Definitely! I'm pretty happy with this one_comma_ can't wait to get it published.	0 
What is the book about?	0 
To say anything about it at all would be giving too much away!	0 
Boo. What genre?	1 
Oh man. I was cleaning out my fridge_comma_ and found something unpleasant.	0 
OH NO that is the worst! Did you clean it up?	0 
Well I threw it out. It was some unidentifiable stuff in a plastic container. It had been in there for months_comma_ I think.	0 
You shoudl write the date on stuff to prevent that from happening again	0 
You know_comma_ that's not a bad idea. Ugh_comma_ it was so disgusting.	1 
My little one got injured	0 
Oh no! What happened?	0 
She fell off a kitchen stool	0 
Ouch. I hope she's okay.	1 
Whew. I had a lot of housework to get done_comma_ but it's finally finished.	0 
thats good_comma_ its always a good feeling after	0 
Yeah_comma_ I'm pretty happy. Now I can just sit back and relax.	0 
thats the way to do it	0 
I agree. Now I don't have anything to worry about for the rest of the day.	1 
i was delighted with how well my nephew did at his little league game	0 
Did his team win?	0 
yes	0 
That's great news! I bet you're so proud.	1 
My clothing is making me crazy	0 
Oh no!  Why are they driving you crazy?	0 
They're totally itchy	0 
That is no good!  I guess it is time for you to go shopping!	1 
i admired the way my nieghbors helped each other out after a storm	0 
Storms are the worst and destroy so much.	0 
they are horrible_comma_ luckily this one wasnt deadly or too destructive	0 
My family went through a big storm a few years ago.	1 
I got a terrible phone call yesterday...	0 
what happened on the phone call?	0 
I found out that my brother died.	0 
I am so sorry about that.	0 
Thank you_comma_ I'm pretty devastated to be honest.	1 
Ugh_comma_ my cat keeps attacking my foot.	0 
Has it made any scratch marks?	0 
Nah_comma_ he just keeps running up_comma_ grabbing and biting_comma_ then running away. It was cute and funny at first_comma_ now it's just irritating.	0 
Have you tried disciplining him in anyway	0 
Yeah_comma_ I've sprayed him with a water bottle a few times_comma_ it doesn't seem to work very well.	0 
Sounds like it's time for a crate.	1 
it is frustrating waiting on hold to speak to a human	0 
Yea_comma_ I hate calling ATT or Verizon they take forever to get on the phone.	0 
it is so annoying!	0 
I think as we get smarter_comma_ it will get better.	1 
I didn't expect to get anything for my birthday from my fiance since he's been broke_comma_ but he gave me a bouquet of flowers and took me out to eat still!	0 
Wow!  Sounds like a keeper right there!  That must have been a nice surprise for you!	0 
It really was! He had to scrimp and save_comma_ but it was worth it for both of us in the end :)	0 
It is always nice when someone gets their priorities right!	1 
So.... my dog got hit by a car last night.	0 
Oh no!  That is horrible!  Is he OK?	0 
No_comma_ unfortunately he didn't make it.	0 
That is really sad!  I hope it was quick and painless.  I hate seeing anything suffer!	0 
Yeah_comma_ I think it was_comma_ but... I'm pretty upset about it.	1 
My son asked to borrow the keys to my car this morning.	0 
Did you let him borrow it?	0 
Yeah. I know most people would be worried about doing something like that_comma_ but... I trust him not to do anything stupid.	0 
That's good to hear. I assume everything went ok?	0 
Yeah_comma_ he brought it back in one piece. Which I'm obviously happy about.	0 
Awesome. Alls well that ends well.	1 
My daughter asked to borrow my car to go out tonight...	0 
Did you say yes?	0 
I haven't given an answer yet. I'm just not sure if it's a wise idea or not.	0 
Where does she plan to go?	0 
She says she's just going to meet some friends at the movies_comma_ but you know how teenagers are.	1 
Boy_comma_ it was nice when I wasn't so poor	0 
Money problems are never fun. Trust me_comma_ I know.	0 
I'm sorry to hear that :( It'd be nice if work paid better	0 
Yeah_comma_ definitely. Have you tried asking for a raise?	1 
I was sad when I had to put my dog down last month	0 
Oh no_comma_ I'm so so sorry. I've always had at least one pet throughout my life_comma_ and they're truly part of the family.	0 
They are very much family. I cannot believe we get so attached.	0 
Yes_comma_ they're honestly more dear to me than my friends. I hope you're doing okay - I'm sure your dog was very loved and had a wonderful life_comma_ so try to take comfort in that.	1 
I was recently promoted at my job. I didn't expect it to happen_comma_ but I got it through hard work so I'm pretty excited about it!	0 
That is great! Doing what?	0 
Thank you! I'm now a district manager for a local chain of businesses. It's not my favorite thing to do_comma_ but the raise is great!	0 
I bet that is nice and probably has good benefits!	1 
I recently went on a long road trip. I wasn't too worried_comma_ though_comma_ because I packed everything I needed to make it as stress-free as possible. '	0 
I can never go on long trips.	0 
Why not? They used to bother me_comma_ but I'm finding that as I get older_comma_ they're not so bad.	0 
I can no longer afford them_comma_ long trips cost the most.	0 
That's unfortunate. I've come to enjoy taking a train as a frugal alternative to flying or driving. No wear and tear on your car_comma_ and you don't have to drive.	1 
I kept laughing at myself for falling down	0 
Oh no!. Are you ok? Must not have been a bad one if you were laughing?	0 
Not bad but it was funny because I slipped on a banana peel!	0 
How ironic. I kind of wish I were there to see it.	1 
I compete in the Highland games around the country. I just got a new kilt and I look amazing. 	0 
I am bad at every game.	0 
It's a little different. It's based in picking up and throwing objects like logs_comma_ hammers that weight 70 pounds and stones that weight 70 pounds. Being Scottish it keeps me feeling at home.	0 
I still could not do that_comma_ I am very weak human person.	0 
You can do anything you set your mind to.	1 
I've been very stressed out at work. I had it in my budget so I hired a new office manager. I'm having issues trusting her.	0 
Do what i did_comma_ quit the job and live at home with mom.	0 
I wish. My mom kicked me out at 14 and I've only seen her a handful of times since over the last 20 years.	0 
I still thing living with a relative is the cheapest way to go.	0 
I actually really want to buy a van and live in it but my wife said no.	1 
I just pulled up my student loan bill. I've been out of school 10 years and still owe 75k.	0 
That's awful! Luckily I paid all mine off_comma_ but I know many people still struggle with it	0 
It started off at 150k so I've paid a lot but it's still crazy. Make me think I would have been better off to just go work construction or something instead of college. 	0 
Yea...the education costs are atrocious and_comma_ honestly_comma_ not even worth it on my opinion. It's just the piece of paper. The material you learn from them can be learned online for free or nearly so	0 
I agree. I feel like I've learned just as much or more from MOCC's since then.	1 
My boss is piling on the work but keeping my pay the same. He claims he can't afford to pay me more_comma_ but I know that's not true.	0 
Typical of most companies.  Ask employees to do more and pay less.	0 
Yep_comma_ it's so frustrating. I'm ready to shake up the system but I feel limited in what I can do_comma_ besides quit.	0 
What kind of job do you have?	1 
I'm so shocked_comma_ my pants fell down in public	0 
I'm sorry_comma_ did anyone see?	0 
I'm hoping not_comma_ but it's possible	0 
I hope you would wear a belt next time.	0 
LOL Yes_comma_ I learned my lesson	1 
My best friend has the best job ever. She is paid to travel the world full time and write Blogs on different locations.	0 
That sounds like a blast.  Compared to my job LOL.  	0 
Yes_comma_ I know. Ever day I drive an hour to the same place that is slowly killing me inside and she is jetting off to explore.	0 
I'm sorry.  I like my job but its certainly not like hers!	1 
Just finished my budget for the week. Woowa_comma_ I'm in trouble it's going to be a rice and beans week.	0 
LOL.  Be careful.. thats a ton of carbs.	0 
It's better then the alternative. One good meal then water and ketchup soup the rest of the week.	0 
eww LOL	0 
Yea_comma_ Rice and beans is so much better then that. 	1 
I just had my birthday_comma_ and my family and fiance did everything they could to make it special. I don't have much_comma_ but I'm thankful to have them at least.	0 
Happy Birthday!	0 
Thank you! I hope your birthday_comma_ whenever it is_comma_ is awesome as well!	0 
What all did they do for you?	0 
Got a big bouquet of flowers_comma_ they took me out to eat (lunch and dinner)_comma_ and we went to the drive-in to top it off :)	1 
I was proud when my dog learned to sit.	0 
How long did it take for you to teach you dog that?	0 
A few days. He was so happy!	0 
I thought I would take longer_comma_ like months!	1 
This week my work offered to let me work an extra day. I thought great overtime. Nope they plan to send me home every other day to even it out	0 
Oh no. Maybe you can get some things done around the house.	0 
Yea like working on my resume and netflix.	0 
Lol_comma_ That sounds like a plan. Working two jobs is hard.	1 
I'm so happy I ate good food	0 
Yummy... what did you eat?  I am hungry.	0 
I had chicken_comma_ asparagus_comma_ and a portobello mushroom	0 
That sounds so good.  Like I love that stuff.	1 
I"m so happy that no one in my family is sick	0 
I am glad no one in your family is sick.	0 
Thank you! I hope no one in yours is either	0 
Thank goodness my family is healthy too.	1 
 went for a job interview. I got the job offer but they offered me less money then I all ready make for more work.	0 
But do they give raises more frequently and do they have better benefits. It may be worth it still_comma_	0 
Not for the first few years. The title would be a move up in status but the pay is about a 20% downgrade. I can't take that loss.	0 
Benefits are worth a lot more than you think sometimes	1 
I'm so excited to go out to dinner tomorrow!	0 
is there a special reason?	0 
No_comma_ we just won't be home so we have to eat out	0 
going anywhere good?	0 
Pickle Barrel	0 
that sounds fun	1 
I'm been loosing weight January. I'm down 50 pounds. I have 10 more to go but I'm happy.	0 
That is great. How have you done it?	0 
I've always walked a lot at work. I average 10 miles a day so kept doing that but I cut out all processed food and drinks. 	0 
That is a lot of walking. I can hardly walk 1 mile.	0 
I average about 95_comma_000 steps a week.	1 
My wife went on a trip for a week to see her family but I had to work so I had to stay home alone.	0 
I have never been on a trip before.	0 
I wish I could have went on this one but I couldn't. It ended up bein a long week by myself.	0 
I have long weeks every single day.	1 
My current job isn't working out_comma_ so I've applied to several others.	0 
I would just quit and live off the government.	0 
Haha_comma_ I would if I could! Sounds a like much more laidback way to live.	0 
Everyone can! Just gotta try.	1 
I found a new stray dog eating out the dumpster last Thursday. Today I officially adopted her.	0

Well congratulations! That must have been nerve-wracking.	1 
So my neighbor just bought a new car. I swear_comma_ he always gets really expensive stuff to show off how successful he is.	0

Maybe... but still. Now I feel like I need to buy one myself.	0 
Do it! I bet you deserve it	1 
Last year my wife got into an accident and we only had one car and I was so worried we wouldn't have a car to get to work	0 
Did you make special arrangements so things went smoothly with one car?	0 
We didn't have many options but the other persons insurance ended up taking care of it all so we got a rental and the car got fixed but i was so scared .	0 
Well I am glad it worked out	1 
Last night I found something in my son's room that made me so mad!	0 
What did you find?!	0 
Drugs! I found drugs. I can't believe this.	0

Do you remember that show I was telling you about the other day? It's getting a new season!	0

Great_comma_ you've found an old treasure.	1 
My girlfriend broke up with me recently...	0 
I'm sorry. How long had you been together?	0 
We were together for 3 years. I can't stand being alone.	0 
Just try and get through each day_comma_ one at a time. Don't think too far ahead.	1 
I keep hearing noises coming from my basement...	0 
That sounds scary.  Are you going to investigate?	0 
I want to_comma_ but I'm a bit scared. Maybe I should take something with me to defend myself_comma_ just in case.	0 
If this were a movie_comma_ I'd be yelling at the screen for you to leave the house and not go down there.	1 
I can't believe this! My son failed a really important test.	0 
I am so sorry to hear that.  Is he planning to retake the test?	0 
I sure hope so. Otherwise he might not be able to graduate.	0 
What test?	0 
It was a math test_comma_ it makes up a pretty large part of his grade.	1 
They other day was my son's first day of school_comma_ and when I dropped him off it brought back so much memories.	0 
That's great. Is that your only son?	0 
Yes_comma_ he's my only son. I cant wait until he get's his first girlfriend like I did in middle school. Those were the days.	0 
I'm sure the memories will be great	1 
So I've been walking around all day with a huge hole in the back of my pants... I just found out about it.	0 
Oh wow! Hopefully no one saw it	0 
If they did_comma_ no one told me about it! So embarrassing.	0 
Im sorry about that. Ive gone through that before. Laughter can be good medicine sometimes	1 
So that new game that I've been looking forward to is coming out in a few weeks!	0 
What is it called ?	0 
Oh_comma_ I'm sure it's not one that you've heard of. I'm pretty excited though_comma_ I've been saving up money for it for a few months now.	0 
Okay_comma_ well I guess I'm happy for you then.	1 
Yesterday_comma_ I caught my neighbor letting his dog poop on my lawn. I had a few choice words for him.	0 
That's understandable.  How receptive was he to your complaint?	0 
He wasn't to happy about me confronting him. I told him if it happens again it might get physical.	0 
Oh_comma_ so it got pretty serious.  I guess he needs to learn to respect boundaries.	1 
I was going through some boxes in my attic today.	0 
Did you find anything?	0 
Yeah_comma_ I found some old toys from my childhood. So many memories came flooding back into my mind.	0 
I bet that was very nostalgic for you.	1 
I can't believe that my coworker got the promotion that I was going for. This is ridiculous.	0 
That's a hard hit to take.  Why do you suspect they got it?	0 
I honestly have no idea. I was definitely more deserving of that position.	0 
So what are you going to do about?  Are you going to start looking for another place to work?	0 
I really think that I might.	1 
I'm so ashamed of myself. I made a big mistake on a project for work.	0 
What did you mess up?	0 
It was something for an important client. Now I'm afraid this is going to screw up my career.	0 
I'm sure you'll be fine.  Have you made many similar mistakes in the past?	0 
No_comma_ this is the first time I've messed up anything like this.	0 
I wouldn't worry too much about it then.  Don't let it get you down.	1 
I bought a used car a few years ago and found 500 dollars tucked in the back seat!	0 
Wow_comma_ that's nice. I hope you treated yourself to something extravagant!	0 
Oh I spent it on a few things. I was just surprised someone didn't find it when it was being cleaned.	0 
I guess they didn't do as good a job as they should have_comma_ lol. Wish my car dealership had missed a few hundred bucks!	0 
I know! made it not so bad that the car I traded in was a junker and not worth much lol	0 
Well_comma_ it was worth $500! That's about what my car's worth these days - had it for years. Still runs great tho'.	1 
I'm going camping with my kids this weekend.	0 
How fun! In a tent or an RV?	0 
In a tent. I just have to make extra sure that I pack all of the supplies that we'll need.	0 
Don't forget a first aid kit! We always need those on camping trips!	1 
On my way home today there was someone in the fast lane going so slow in front of me.	0 
Ugh_comma_ that's so annoying.  How long did you have to follow behind them?	0 
about 5 miles. there was too much trafic in the slow lane_comma_ couldn't get over	0 
I hope you weren't late for anything important!	1 
I was watching television earlier today when I came across a channel that was showing a bunch of cartoons that I loved when I was younger.	0 
memory lane right there! which cartoons? 	0 
It was a whole bunch of different ones from the 90's. Man_comma_ they really reminded me of my childhood.	0 
Very cool I havent seen the older style cartoons myself in years.	1 
I keep getting strange phone calls. It's creeping me out.	0 
That would creep me out too what kind of calls?? 	0 
The person on the other end just keeps making really weird sounds until I hang up. I'm not sure what I should do about it.	0 
Alright that would creep me out too. Block the number or change yours!! weird. 	1 
My boyfriend told me he quit drinking_comma_ but I just found a bunch of empty liquor bottles he hid in his room.	0 
Uh oh. Are you going to confront him about it?	0 
Absolutely_comma_ but it probably won't go well. He needs help but he won't accept it.	0 
Well I hope that he actually listens to you this time and gets help.	1 
Yay! I'm finally getting a promotion at work!	0 
Congratulations_comma_ that's awesome! I hope you're getting a raise too!	0 
Yeah_comma_ a raise will definitely come with it. I've put a lot of work into this_comma_ and it finally paid off!	0 
Hope you treat yourself to celebrate_comma_ you deserve it!	1 
So I might be up for a promotion soon at work!	0 
That sounds amazing! When will you find out? 	0

i envy my friend who is off work today	0 
I bet.  It is nice to have a day off every now and then	0 
it definitely is	0 
I like having days off to do absolutly nothing.  It helps with stress.	1 
Ugh_comma_ my cat keeps climbing up the curtains in my room.	0 
That's the worst.  Is it damaging the curtains too much?	0 
Yeah_comma_ he's tearing them up. I really wish he'd stop.	0 
Is there anything you can put on them or near them to stop him?	0 
I'm not sure_comma_ but I'm going to try to find something that will do that.	1 
We've decided to adopt another cat from the shelter!	0 
That is great! Adopt_comma_ don't shop! Always a great motto!	0 
Agreed_comma_ that's my motto! This is a high-kill shelter too_comma_ so we'll definitely be saving a life :)	0 
That is great_comma_ I commend you!	1 
i am nervous for a meeting i have later	0 
Have you prepared enough for it?	0

Well Im sure you be fine. Just relax.	1

That's good to hear! Have you been eating healthy?	0 
yes definitely_comma_ and getting plenty of exercise 	0 
That's great! Keep up the good work!	1 
I bought some new food for my dog_comma_ and he refuses to eat it.	0 
thats strange_comma_ my dog will eat anything lol	0 
Yeah_comma_ that's what I thought about mine too. I bought a huge bag of the stuff_comma_ too. It's so irritating.	0 
maybe he will start warming up to it soon	0 
I certainly hope so.	1 
My coworker gave a really nice presentation at work today.	0 
About what?!	0 
Oh it was just boring work stuff_comma_ about a client. But I was really awed by the amount of work that she put into it.	0 
That's awesome. I'm glad she did well.	1 
I've been working hard and doing a great job for several months_comma_ but still no raise.	0 
thats always a bummer when you put in such work and get nothing in return 	0 
Yeah_comma_ especially when my boss promised to pay me more. Might be time to quit!	0 
Oh I just quit a few weeks ago due to a similar situation actually! Never been happier! 	1 
im nervous about taking a test soon	0 
Did you study for it or are you winging it?	0 
i feel pretty prepared	0 
Don't worry then.  You did you part!! I'm sure you will do fine!	1 
My roommate is gone for the week_comma_ on a business trip. It's way too quiet around here.	0 
Maybe you should try and have a party?	0 
That's a good idea. I can't stand being alone in this place much longer.	0 
Yes being alone is not very fun.	1 
My birthday is coming up next week. I'm really looking forward to it.	0 
What will your new age be?	0 
I'll be turning 35. And some friends are coming that I haven't seen in years_comma_ it'll be great to see them again.	0 
You should have a great time_comma_ congrats on the new age!	1 
My wife and I got a divorce. The house is so quiet without her and the kids being here.	0 
I went through a similar thing a few years back.  Everything seemed hollow to me.  How long has it been?	0 
About two years now and everything still seems very odd to me.	0 
If your depressed_comma_ speak to someone.  If it's just adjusting to the change_comma_ that comes in time.	1 
Uh oh. I'm in trouble now.	0 
Why is it that you are in trouble?	0 
I lost a really important document at work... telling my boss is going to be so embarrassing.	0 
Can you just replace the document?	0 
If only it were that easy. It had several signatures on it.	1 
There's a creepy guy that comes by at work that won't stop bothering me. He writes crazy letters_comma_ and keeps calling on the phone "just to chat" with me.	0 
I would be reporting that to the police for sure. 	0 
I tried. They said they can't do anything unless he actually tries to physically harm me_comma_ which is insane to me.	0 
Thats true right.. i forgot how stupid the law can be sometimes. Thats insane. 	1 
My father was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer.	0 
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. That must be very difficult for you and your family.	0

I'm starting a new job next week! Can't wait to be doing something different for a change!	0 
That's great. What will you be doing at your new job?	0

Sometimes being a manager is the worst job you can have at a place_comma_ you seem to be the one who gets blamed for everything.	1 
Recently_comma_ I got passed over for a promotion at my job.	0 
Aw man_comma_ that sucks. Promotions usually aren't given fairly in my experience. Was that the case for you too?	0 
No_comma_ the guy that got it was qualified_comma_ it's just I really wanted the job. It would have really help my career.	0 
I'll keep my fingers crossed for you that you get that promotion next time!	1 
I bought a scratch off lottery ticket the other day_comma_ and won $5000.	0

I almost passed out_comma_ I have never won so much money before.	0 
That is great! I wish I was lucky like that!	1 
Had to take my cat to the vet. He's got a bad injury on his paw and it hasn't been healing.	0

He's 8 years old. They're going to have to put him down - turns out he has feline aids :(	0

Haven't been paid for it yet_comma_ but people that visit are welcome to put in an offer for anything they see! Fingers crossed someone wants mine!	0 
Hopefully! that would be so amazing! 	1 
I was enjoying the morning watching the kids play in the pool.	0 
That sounds like such a fun_comma_ peaceful morning. So jealous you have a pool_comma_ it's been scorching outside!	0 
Well it's only a kiddie pool_comma_ kids are very little. It was a very nice morning.	0 
Ah okay_comma_ nice for the kiddos then. They grow up fast_comma_ so hold onto these moments while you can:)	1 
As a child_comma_ I was mean to my sister all the time and I still feel awful about it.	0 
Aw_comma_ well when your younger you don't do those things on purpose. I think everyone is mean to their siblings every now and then.	0 
True_comma_ but she's very sensitive. I'm sure it still bothers her. I try to make up for it today_comma_ but I never can take those things back.	0 
Have you talked to her about it? Maybe she doesn't really think about it anymore.	1 
my husband and i lostour daughter 2years ago and i don't care to celebrate mother's day and he still impressed me with a gift	0 
I am so sorry to hear about your loss. What did he get you?	0 
he got my favorite flower_comma_ an orchid a card and made dinner 	0 
That was very nice of him. I'm glad you have a nice husband.	0 
thanks	1 
Went to get an oil change the other day. Turns out I didn't need one for another 1_comma_000 miles_comma_ and I felt like such a fool.	0 
Well better to be sooner than later on something like that. Dont be hard on yourself. 	0 
Agreed_comma_ and it had been 5 months so I figured I was due. The mechanic was really condescending which was what made it embarrassing!	0 
Thats so silly its none of his worry. He needs to hush up. lol 	1 
My cat somehow managed to lock himself in the bathroom last night. I still can't figure out how he did it.	0 
Wow! He sounds like a super smart cat! How did you get him out of there?	0 
He is! Well_comma_ both smart and dumb haha. Had to use a knitting needle to pick the lock!	0 
Well at least you managed to save him!	1 
I've got a coworker with zero social skills_comma_ and it's driving me batty. She can't seem to tell no one wants to listen to her talk for 30 minutes straight.	0 
Oh man_comma_ I've definitely had a few coworkers like that myself before. What does she even talk about?	0 
If you make a comment on anything_comma_ say cats_comma_ she'll go into a monologue about everything she's ever learned about a cat (most of it wrong).	0 
That's the worst! Some people_comma_ once they get started_comma_ they just can't stop themselves. It's like opening a can of Pringles.	1 
We had an annoying client the other day_comma_ and I went to the breakroom to complain about her to my coworkers (thinking she couldn't hear).	0 
Did it feel good to get it out?	0 
It did at first_comma_ until I left the room and saw she was sitting right by the door where she could hear everything! It was humiliating and I felt really bad for her after that.	0 
Oh no_comma_ that's awkward! Did you get in trouble for it?	1 
I found some baby kittens in my yard_comma_ their mother was dead. I nursed them to health and found homes for them.	0 
That's heartbreaking_comma_ but you're amazing for doing that. Cats are my favorite and I've rescued many animals. It's a lot of work.	0 
They are my favorite_comma_ too. I love how independent they are.	0 
Yes_comma_ and when they love you it feels special_comma_ because they don't love everyone like dogs do. You've racked up a lot of good karma for saving them!	1 
Finances aren't great right now. I've got a lot of bills that are overdue_comma_ but I can't afford to pay them :(	0 
I'm there too. Struggling each day. It really gets old.	0 
I'm sorry we're both in this situation. It really sucks_comma_ and it feels unfair because it's not for lack of effort.	0 
Yeah_comma_ that's right. I've been pushing 70 hours working a week for as long as I can remember. Hold out_comma_ maybe it'll change.	1 
I was out of school for over a year and thought i forgot everything before taking this big test	0 
You would be so suprised at how much stays all the way in the nooks and crannies of your brain when you take a break!	0 
I know it was nerve wrecking but studying all the time and i mean al the time paid off 	0 
Im glad it paid off for you_comma_ you must be super proud!	1 
A few years back I got laid off from my job because they were losing too much money. It broke me_comma_ I really loved that job.	0 
Oh no_comma_ I am so sorry. What did you do?	0 
To be honest_comma_ I fell into a pretty deep depression. No one wanted to hire me. It was tough.	0 
That is tough. That must have been quite the trying time. Did you eventually find work?	0 
I did_comma_ yeah. And strangely enough_comma_ the company hired me back a few years later when they were doing better cashflow-wise. 	1 
im stoked to go see some old friends tomorrow night	0 
Good_comma_ how long has it been since you saw them last?	0 
about a year and a half!	0 
I hope you all have some fun.	1 
I'm SO ready for fall - it's been incredibly hot all summer_comma_ and I need my favorite season to hurry up & get here!	0 
Oh yes_comma_ fall is definitely my favorite season as well! I love fall scents!	0 
Me too! Wearing comfy sweaters_comma_ snuggling up with a hot drink_comma_ and fall smell on the air...can't wait for it!	0 
It is the best season_comma_ by far! Plus_comma_ Halloween!	1 
A bunch of fruit flies appeared in my apartment out of nowhere the other day. I think it's because of some old veggies in my fridge. Totally gross.	0 
Oh man_comma_ those things are awful and reproduce like crazy.  We left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere! The best trick is putting a little apple cider vinegar in a jar_comma_ a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cling wrap and put holes in it.  They will gravitate toward it and you'll catch a bunch! Just keep changing it every few days.	0 
Thanks for the tip_comma_ I will try that! I cleaned out the fridge and most of them seemed to just go away. I have no idea where they go but don't really care either as long as they're gone!	0 
Seriously_comma_ gone is good.  They do have bacteria on them and lay their eggs on fruit and veggies and the larva burrow into the fruit or veggie so its good you trashed it all. Glad you're free of them!	1 
I'm getting married next year! Hoping everything goes smoothly and we get the wedding we want to have.	0 
That is so exciting! It can be stressful and expensive planning a wedding.	0 
Boy are you right about that. I was really excited during the early planning stages_comma_ but it's been stressful ever since.	0 
It really gets stressful when you get down to the last minute. You are always so worried you are going to forget something.	1 
My friends went ahead and gave me a baby shower that I didn't know about.	0 
oh that was nice of them	0 
Yeah_comma_ they had told my husband about it so he could get me there.	0 
haha thats pretty fun	1 
I have an adorable hamster that doesn't look like he's doing well. He is on the old side for hamsters_comma_ and I'm worried he won't live much longer.	0 
Oh no_comma_ I am sorry to hear that. I hope that he gets to feeling better. How old is he?	0 
Thank you_comma_ me too! He's a little over 2 years old. I'd hate to lose him_comma_ but they usually don't live more than 2-3 years.	0 
Oh I see_comma_ I can understand your concern. Perhaps he will live longer than most hamsters!	1 
I went back to work for my former company recently. They laid me off a few years ago when things were tough. Coming back was a little scary but I was thrilled!	0 
That is awesome!  I would be really excited if I were in yyour shoes!	0 
Yes_comma_ that's exactly how I felt. I suspected they'd been in trouble for a while so when they asked me to come back and help them out it felt really good.	0 
I hope you go far in your job!  Good luck!	0 
Thank you!	1 
im upset that my neighbor's dog is sick	0 
That is quite upsetting. Do you know what ails it?	0 
no they are at the vet now	0 
Well I certainly hope that the dog gets to feeling better. Are you close friends with this canine companion?	1 
Well i had spent the good part of a week organising the best weekend away with my hubby for our 10th wedding anniversary. Spa day_comma_ great dinner_comma_ concert and of course the parents were booked to mind the kids for the weekend.  However all did not go to plan...	0 
Oh no_comma_ what happened? Hopefully the whole weekend didn't get ruined!	0 
Well unfortunately the day before we were due to go my little 2 year old daughter woke up covered in spots.  As the day went on more and more appeared and she had a roaring temperature.  We realised she had chickenpox.  She was feeling so miserable and of course all she wanted was her mummy and daddy.  It was a bit depressing and part of me was devastated but our weekend away was not to be.  Sure kids always come first dont they?!	0 
Poor little thing_comma_ chicken pox are the worst. On the bright side_comma_ you still got to spend your anniversary with your husband_comma_ just not_comma_ you know_comma_ in the way you hoped. Hope you guys get to have a make-up weekend soon!	0 
Very true and thats the way to look at it. I was a bit dispirited but the hotel were great and re-arranged it for us and to be honest I could never have left my baby when she was poorly. The best made plans dont always work out when you have kids_comma_ but hey I wouldnt change them for the world.	1 
My neighbor has a brand new Tesla and every time I look at it I get so envious. I know it's stupid_comma_ I should be happy for him that he has such a cool car.	0 
Wow thats nice.  What do you drive?	0 
Well that's the thing_comma_ I don't. I bike everywhere. Don't get me wrong_comma_ I love my bike and it's a great way to stay fit. 	0 
You have to think of the positives.  Just because they have a new car doesnt mean their life is great.  They could be watching you wishing they were fit and healthy like you are.	0 
That is a really good way to put it_comma_ I will definitely keep that in mind next time I find myself pining after his car.	0 
lol and some day you might you buy your own new Tesla_comma_ if you feel like it!	0 
A Tesla with a bike rack!	0 
Exactly!	1 
I'm happy my package just arrived	0 
oh thats nice	0 
im glad it came earlier	0 
yea i would be to	1 
I'm feeling nostalgic today	0 
Why's that?	0 
I found some old keepsakes in the basement ealier	0 
Nostalgia is a weird feeling.	1 
I've got a fun weekend coming up_comma_ and I'm really looking forward to it!	0 
Nice_comma_ what do you have planned?	0 
Going to the drive-in_comma_ out to eat_comma_ and probably minigolf. Nothing particularly special_comma_ just haven't had fun in awhile!	0 
Sound great_comma_ I'm happy for you!	1 
I recently had a project of mine recognized in a national publication!	0 
Wow!  That must feel great!  You should be proud of this accomplishment.  People can go their whole lives without ever being published!	0 
It felt amazing to be recognized for my work_comma_ and in a publication I respect to boot! 	0 
Congratulations!  I wish I could be published.	0 
Well I certainly wasn't expecting it so who knows_comma_ maybe one day you will!	1 
I am going to Disney next year. I want to write a list of everything to bring.	0 
What are some things you will bring?	0 
I'm not really sure. I think if I write things out that I could possibly need I won't forget anything.	0 
It's a good idea to write thing down that you might forget.	1 
Things have been rough for me lately_comma_ but thankfully I've got family and a fiance that are helping me through it.	0 
What is wrong? Are you okay?	0 
I'm in a lot of debt thanks to my car needing expensive repairs_comma_ and haven't been able to afford it. It's pretty depressing not being able to pay your bills :/	0 
I am so sorry. I hope you get all the help you need.	1 
the rain today is frustrating	0 
We have been getting a lot of rain as well. I have to mow my lawn so much.	0 
im not a fan of it at all	0 
Yeah I know what you mean. I can't wait for the rainy season to end.	1 
The other day I was riding my bike and this woman ran a stop sign_comma_ nearly hitting me. Thank goodness I was paying attention and was able to stop in time.	0 
Oh my goodness_comma_ I've almost gotten hit while on a bike before and it's terrifying. I'm so glad you're alright!	0 
I wish people would pay more attention. I try to do my best to follow the rules of the road both when I'm on my bike and in a car.	0 
Ditto. It's not hard to do_comma_ and so many lives would be saved if people would just follow the rules. I'll send good vibes out so nothing bad happens to you in the future!	0 
Thank you_comma_ I appreciate that!	1 
My boyfriend proposed to me_comma_ and I accepted! I thought he didn't want to get married so it was a welcome surprise.	0 
Wow_comma_ congratulations! Have you guys set a date yet?	0 
Thank you! We're hoping to get married sometime next year_comma_ but man weddings are expensive. It may be further off than I'd like!	0 
Oh I feel you_comma_ I used to work in the wedding industry. It's crazy how much it costs even for the most basic wedding.	1 
I just had my birthday and I ate WAY too much. Had a good time_comma_ but boy do I feel bad for all of that food. I'm supposed to be eating healthier!	0 
I know exactly how that happens. Sometimes the food is just too good to pass up.	0 
No kidding. Had free refills on a root beer float too_comma_ and how could I say no to that?	0 
Well I say go for it. It is only your birthday once a year. The other 364 days can make up for it.	1 
i am pleased with the day im having today	0 
Glad to hear you are having a good day. Wish every day was like that.	0 
me too but we wouldnt appreciate the good days if it werent for the bad	0 
That is true. It puts things in context.	1 
Every night before bed_comma_ we read the Bible to our son. I love when he relates what he learned to real life.	0 
That is really awesome! That is so important to be involved in his life like that. 	0 
It is. And shows that he is listening. 	0 
It does! Kids can understand things about the bible that most adults overlook. 	1 
Our mail carrier keeps leaving packages outside instead of putting them in the lobby.	0 
that is frustrating_comma_ especially if the weather isnt ideal 	0 
Exactly! It rained the other day and my package was totally ruined.	0 
that is unfortunate_comma_ im sorry that happened!	0 
Thank you! At least I was able to get it replaced.	1 
My friend left my front door open when she was house-sitting for me. My cat snuck out and was killed.	0 
That isn't good. Are you mad at your friend?	0 
I was really upset at the time but once I had some time I realized it was an honest mistake. She felt really bad about it.	0 
Are you going to get another cat?	0 
When I'm ready_comma_ I think yes.	1 
I can't wait for it to be Christmas already. Just thinking about that time of year makes me really happy.	0 
I feel the same way as well!  I get really excited thinking about decorating and giving gifts!	0 
Exactly! And the food_comma_ and friends. All of it is just so lovely.	0 
I agree!  Everything that surrounds Christmas makes me smile and feel content.  It makes me thankful for everything good in life!	1 
Each day waking up I can't believe how lucky am I just to be alive.	0 
That's a great outlook I think. We often lose focus of that very important fact.	0 
Yes_comma_ I don't need anything. I have something to eat and a roof over my head. I really can't ask for anything more.	0 
That's inspiring to me. I will try to think more like that as well whenever I get stressed in life.	1 
I went running for the first time in months. I could not believe it. I was able to run a full 8 miles with out taking a break.	0 
8 Miles!? That's very impressive.  I bet I could barely make it a mile!	0 
Yes_comma_ my first time out in 60 days. I impressed my self.	0 
Have you been a long time runner before that?	0 
Not really. A few years ago I got tired of being fat so one day I just went out and started running. Two months ago I stopped due to hurting my back surfing. I got the all clear yesterday and went back out.	1 
Just gave my wife access to my credit card. I'm worried but excited I can trust her. Do you ever have issues trusting people?	0 
I can relate to that!  Yeah_comma_ my wife with my credit card_comma_ lol!	0 
It's taken me 11 years to get to this point. Last time I let her have at it. She bought us a trip to mexico on my credit card.	0 
Haha_comma_ I can understand the hesitation then.  But was the vacation at least worth the money?	0 
It was fun. Adults only resort_comma_ all inclusive_comma_ private swimming pool off the room but cost 500 a day.	1

Got any trips planned this year?|Did you share it with anyone else?|You have some very nice parents_comma_ when I graduated my parents said pay us more rent now. 	0 
An extra 40k a year but it would be highly stressful. Currently I have the highest ratings in the USA_comma_ I'm sure any new employer would want me to bring them up to that stage as well. 	0 
Oh wow_comma_ an additional 40K is a lot! I'd be willing to put up with quite a bit for a pay increase that large.	0 
I currently work 50 hours a week. I'd be working around 75-80 a week then.	0 
Oh wow. I'll be honest and say it wouldn't be worth it for me! What's an extra 40K if you're never not at work to enjoy it?	1 
I took my wife surfing for the first time today. within an hour she was riding waves_comma_ Color me impressed!	0 
Oh wow_comma_ I think it'd take me much longer to not bust my butt! That is impressive!	0 
Yes_comma_  I was surprised. I've been at it my entire life and never seen anyone pick it up so quickly. She is not even athletic.	0 
Maybe she's more athletic than you think! She might be better than you soon. Better watch out!	1 
A friend of mine bought a new car	0 
awesome! what kind?	0 
Tesla_comma_ I've had my eye on the model for some time	0 
oh man those are super nice! all electric is pretty neat	1 
A friend of mine got a new high paying job	0 
That's good on his part_comma_ how do you feel about it?	0 
I thought it was amazing he got it_comma_ seemed like a tough job to land	0 
That's awesome_comma_ and I agree_comma_ the job market is tough now a days.  High paying or not.	1 
A co-worker of mine was late delivering materials for a project	0 
Oh that's no good. Any special reason why they were late?	0 
The guy just doesn't seem to care	0 
That's a bad attitude to have. I hope he can straighten up a bit if we wants to keep working there.	1 
Going to the doctor for the first time since 2001 tomorrow. I'm dreading telling the doctor how long it has been since my last visit. 	0 
It will be okay. It's always hard making that step_comma_ but it's good for your health to do it.	0 
I'm only going because my insurance gives me a gift card for going. I'm in perfect health. But still ashamed.	0 
I wish my insurance would give me something like that! It's good to go anyways.	1 
im scared of this big test tomorrow	0 
Have you studied for it?  Always helps to prepare!	0 
yes i have_comma_ still nervous though	0 
Good luck_comma_ I'm sure you will do fine!	1 
My wife and I are on a diet together for the last month. We have been doing great but today on my way home from work I stopped for Ice cream and did not tell her.	0 
Hey everyone trips up a little. What you need to remember is that you and your wife made a commitment and you should follow through on that. 	0 
Yea I know. The real issues is that I want to stop again from more tomorrow. 	0 
It's ok to have a cheat day everyone once in a while_comma_ but you can't give in. Be strong!	1 
I just turned in my dissertation. I'm scared it will not pass and all my work toward my masters will be for nothing.	0 
You only get to do it once?	0 
Yes_comma_ you turn it in then go in front of a board of people. In my case 10 people. If they don't like it I can't go one to work on my PhD and will need to write another. This one has taken 2 years to write.	0 
Oh no. I hope it goes well for you. That's a lot of hard work.	1 
I finally got a raise at my job	0 
Congrats!	0 
I was pretty happy_comma_ it was long overdue	0 
Was it more than expected?	1 
The other day I was drinking and sent an email I shouldn't have. I felt so stupid when I woke up and realized what I'd done.	0 
That has happened to me_comma_ but with texts though lol	0 
Yeah I've done that_comma_ too. The funny thing is I'm usually pretty eloquent even when I'm drunk so I don't think the recipient even realized I was drunk when I wrote it.	0 
Did you apologize?	0 
No_comma_ when they responded I just played it off like I meant to send it. Everything turned out fine!	0 
LOL	1 
My car has been having issues lately	0 
what's wrong with it?	0 
Engine issues I think_comma_ not sure if the car will make it	0 
can you fix it?	1 
Got on the scale today. I've only been on a diet 2 weeks and I'm down 17 pounds.	0 
That is great news. Have you also been working out?	0 
Not really. I average 10 miles a day walking at work but did that when I was fat as well. I cut out all processed foods and drinks.	0 
Has it been easy or hard to do that?	0 
Rough. I used to like Iced tea and now only drink black coffee or water. I miss flavor. Plus it's a lot of work cooking everything.	1 
I took some candy a friend left out	0 
did they notice it was missing?	0 
Not yet_comma_ I plan on compensating my friend for what I took	0 
well at least you are attempting to be honest about it.	1 
I just realized today I have not been home to where my family is from in a little over 10 years.	0 
Ohh wow! Are you excited?	0 
No I'm not going. I don't have time and my family dose not talk to me. I just miss home.	0 
Ohh that stinks. I dont blame you though	1 
The other day this creepy guy followed me around the store and chased me out to the parking lot. He just wouldn't take a hint.	0 
That's very creepy_comma_ did he say anything to you?	0 
Yeah that's what made it weird_comma_ it was kind of like he was trying to hit on me but just awkward. But he was really pushy about it.	0 
Those are definitely the scary types_comma_ they don't recognize social cues at all.	0 
I hope that's all it was and not that he had some bad motive.	1 
A close friend said she was having problems with her knee	0 
Ouch!  Did she hurt it or is it a degenerative thing? I hope she can find help with physical therapy.	0 
Hopefully she will see a doctor soon about it	0 
Oh good.  Hopefully she'll try to fix it with physical therapy first.  Some doctors love to do surgery right away when its not necessary.  Recommend that she get a second opinion.  Hope she resolves it!	1 
A co-worker stole my lunch	0 
I've never understood that_comma_ it's not like they can't afford to eat since they have a job! Do you know which coworker it was?	0 
Not entirely sure_comma_ I marked my lunch so they knew it wasn't theirs	0 
Next time bring your lunch in a biohazard bag_comma_ maybe they will leave it alone.	1 
A friend of mine revealed a deep dark secret I told her in confidence to everyone. 	0 
What did you do?	0 
I blocked her and sent her a long text explaining how angry and disappointed I was. I didn't know what else to do.	0 
You definitely can't be too careful these days	0 
You're right. It makes me less likely to trust others in the future.	1 
Every single time I go in the office bathroom someone comes in and needs something. If I don't go to the bathroom no one comes in all day.	0 
how do you know no one goes in if you arent in there?	0 
Because I work in the same little office alone all day. Today I did not use the bathroom no one came in. yesterday I went twice and each time I went I had someone waiting on me when I got back to my desk.	0 
ok	1 
I discovered my cat peed on my bath mat when I got out of the shower today and the mat was wet.	0 
Oh no! That stinks. I've never had a cat specifically because I've never been good with the idea of being able to train them. Plus it seems like you just get the one personality_comma_ and they never grow to like you. But I'm biased.	0 
It's funny you say that_comma_ I actually like that about cats. They are independent and not too needy_comma_ which sort of describes me! I love my cats... the peeing on my bath mat aside.	0 
Yeah_comma_ I know they definitely suit some people. I actually now technically have one... my roommate wanted to get one_comma_ and I felt too bad to say no. And he actually is a pretty nice guy_comma_ mostly because he's been affectionate from the start. So_comma_ we'll see how it goes! Sorry again about your mat.	0 
Here's hoping your cat grows on you_comma_ they have a funny ability to do so.	1 
I got the courage to contact a potential client the other day and set a rate for my work that's higher than I usually charge.	0 
Wow good for you! I hope that it works out for you!	0 
Thanks! The work isn't terribly exciting but it felt good not having to negotiate knowing the client wanted me to do work for them.	0 
Yeah and I bet the higher paycheck will make the work worth it. 	0 
That always makes it worth it to be honest!	1 
Someone hit my car and fled the scene	0 
What! First of all_comma_ are you alright?	0 
Yeah_comma_ I'm fine_comma_ the car was parked	0 
Oh_comma_ well that's something_comma_ at least. I can't believe people are such cowards_comma_ though.	1 
'm promoting two staff members on Sunday. They work hard and are great people.	0 
That's great. Do they know?	0 
They have no clue. They know I ask them to do more then others but are clueless. I'm excited for them and the also the stress load they will take off of me. 	0 
Well that is awesome. I bet they won't let you down in the new positions either	1 
'm running my first Marathon Sunday. I'm scared that maybe I did not train hard enough.	0 
I have never run a marathon	0 
No better time to try then now.	0 
You can try your best and if you don't finish there is always the next one	0 
I will not run If I can't finish. I'm stubborn I'll finish or kill over.	0 
Well that's some sort of motivation lol	1 
Just finished my Master's degree now time to take on a PhD	0 
Congratulations!  What are you getting your PhD in?	0 
Astrophysics	0

I have another 3-4 years then I'll go into teaching.	1 
I start my last year of my Masters program Friday. I'm scared I feel like I'm all ready behind.	0 
Have you tried to talk to your teacher?	0 
No it's mostly I feel behind on my thesis. When I started they told us keep up or drop out. I should have known_comma_ it's one of the hardest schools to get into.	0 
What school is this you are talking about?	0 
Cornell University_comma_ after this year I transfer to Princeton for my PhD	1 
I spent all summer getting ready to write my thesis. I can't wait to get time to start.	0 
That's pretty cool that you're motivated and excited to start it. Most people would be scared and procrastinating. You'll do great.	0 
I need to get it over. I need to start paying back student loans. It's the last thing I need to do before I can get hired as a Ad Professor. 	0 
Sounds like you have a plan laid out. It also sounds like you've already accomplished so much.. You should be very proud. I'm with you_comma_ I have over $40_comma_000 in student loans. Such a crazy pressure on someone right when they graduate. Good luck!	0 
I've been paying on mine and have 75 still to pay. Then I want a PhD so that will be another 50k	1 
I love to be snuggled up with attention and time with my boyfriend when he doesn't I get sad and jealous. 	0

Aw_comma_ it takes time! Making friends isn't always so easy so give it a little bit of time	0 
Yes_comma_ but how do I even talk to people I don't know?	0 
The best thing to do is join clubs and get involved. You generally make friends by association!	1 
I felt very great a few weeks ago when i helped an elderly women bag her groceries	0 
that is really nice of you to do_comma_ not a lot of people help others like that anymore	0 
Yeah thats true most people don't.  I love helping those in need it's a great feeling	0 
same with me if i ever see someone that could use my help_comma_ i will most likely bring it to you	1 
I can't believe I didn't get that promotion at work :(	0 
Ah dang... Sorry that happened to you. It stinks too because a lot of the time that stuff is just decided by who is liked more_comma_ or who has better connections_comma_ and not actual merit. If you're good_comma_ I'm sure you will get recognized at some point.	0 
Agreed_comma_ it's a popularity contest!	0 
Well_comma_ keep a good attitude. If you like the work and the job_comma_ hopefully that will be enough.	1 
My wife cheated on me! It's absurd!!	0

Remember when we were young and could run through the fields of flowers? I miss it.	0 
Yeah_comma_ those were better times. Brings back good memories.	0 
Maybe we can relive such times through our children.	0 
Well_comma_ maybe yours. Mine just want to sit inside and play on their phones all day.	1 
I don't understand why people come to work to just not do their jobs I have a coworker like this.	0 
Oh man..I have had those too..and where I am the one getting crap even though I do my job and everyone elses..I HATE sitting around at work...I either want to work or go home. I hope your boss knows your co-worker is lazy?	0 
We are on the same page I have to pick up their slack and it just irritates me to the upmost it's like just quit please or give me a raise for doing double work. 	0 
I AGREE and frankly if your boss does not see this and doesn't give you praise then I would quit as well or contact human resources! This kind of stuff is not acceptable.	1 
The desert was incredible! The taste! The look! The feel as I ate it!	0

My friend taught his dog some tricks. It's really fun to watch!	0 
O yea? I	0 
It's amazing how quickly the dog responds to the commands. My friend must really know what he's doing.	0 
I'm trying to teach mine tricks myself* I think that's fun to watch!	1 
I was taking an important test in one of my classes the other day... I'm ashamed to say that I cheated.	0 
I've cheated on occasion. It's never right but it's easy. At least you're ashamed of it.	0 
Yeah... I'm thinking about coming clean about it to my professor before he finds out on his own.	0 
That's your decision to make_comma_ but I think it would at least put you in control of the situation.	1 
My wife and I are going out to one of my favorite restaurants tonight.	0 
That sounds fun. Is it a special occasion?	0 
Not really_comma_ just felt like going out. I'm thinking about ordering something I haven't had before_comma_ but.... I don't know. I'm weird about trying new foods.	0 
I understand. Sticking with what you know seems safer.	1 
I bought a used car a couple months ago and I have to say it's holding up really well for a 6 year old car. It's like new.	0

I am_comma_ You never know what shape a used car really is until you have it for a while.	0 
true that_comma_ you cant be too sure until you use it	1 
I have a performance review coming up at work in a couple of weeks.	0 
Tough week ahead. Do you think you have met your expectations thus far?	0

I got a threatening phone call... and now I'm scared.	0

Have you thought about spraying your garden?	0 
I thought about it but they were coming from the grass around it and I'm worried the dog would get sick if I sprayed the grass	0 
Perhaps there is an all natural remedy you could try	0 
Hopefully. there were so many I thought I was in a jungle.	1

My friends went to dinner without me	0

That must of been fun to go through.	0 
It was brilliant.  My mum must have gathered it up over the years.  I spent hours going through it all.  it made me feel so nostalgic.  I think its a great idea though_comma_ I might start doing it for my kids.	0

That sounds unfortunate. You must have been so annoyed with him!	0 
I was! He had an uncanny knack of blocking me and taking up the whole width of the aisle.	0 
People like that should just do shopping online instead of ruining the experience for everyone else!	1 
When I see little homeless girls I feel like a father.	0 
Do you have daughters of your own?	0

I paid off my credit card before buying my house.  I didnt realize how expensive owning would be and after some repairs I owe more than I started with on my card.	0 
That's really good! Do you think you're ever going to use the card again?	0 
Im hoping I wont have to.  Unless something major comes up I'm not planning on putting anything on credit again.	0 
That is wise. I too am trying to pay off my credit card debts. After that_comma_ I'm cutting them up.	1 
I was with some friends and went up to my room.  It was late at night and the lights were off.  When I left my room a bat flew at me and landed on my leg.	0 
That would have really scared me.	0 
It did scare me.  I let out a scream.  One of my friends went to school for wildlife.  He captured the bat and let it outside which was great.	0 
I bet you are thankful that your friend was there.	1 
I brought home a cake for my family_comma_ but I ate all of it! Ugh.	0 
All of it??? Oh no. How bad do you feel right now?	0 
Uhm_comma_ I feel awesome in my tummy_comma_ but bad in my heart LOL	0 
Haha I bet. Im sure they were looking forward to it.	1 
My roommate was very forgetful.  He would sometimes leave his dogs poop bags inside instead of bringing them out to the garage.	0 
ewww.	0 
It was gross.  All of a sudden you would smell something and then notice the bag sitting there.	0 
Why would it be in the house to begin with? does the dog poop in the house?	1 
I was watching TV and saw people with a happy family. It breaks my heart.	0 
You are having trouble with family ?	0 
My family isn't close_comma_ it's depressing.	0 
Mine isn't either. Are you married?	1 
I'm so hyped_comma_ I'm going to the movies!	0 
Awesome! What are you going to see?	0 
Not sure yet_comma_ I'll have to ask my friends	0 
Whatever it is_comma_ I hope you have a good time!	1 
I broke my leg_comma_ it's so upsetting.	0 
Oh no!  How'd you do that?	0 
I fell off a roof!	0 
What were you doing on the roof?	1 
We decided to go fishing last week.	0 
Did you catch anything?	0 
No!  And I was so confident that we would!	0 
Did you at least have fun?	0 
We did!  And some of the research work that we did let us experiment more than normal.	1 
My daughter graduated high school!	0 
congrats! you must be proud!	0 
I am_comma_ thanky ou!	0 
My daughter is only in eigth grade we have a while to go	1 
I believed my father wouldn't let me down.	0 
That is good to feel that way. You don't want to feel like someone close to you would let you down. Did it work out for you?	0 
No_comma_ he totally bailed on me_comma_ as usual.	0 
Oh I am sorry. That is sad. Remember that it is not your fault. I would think of the people who have been there for you. 	1 
I'm about to move and I'm terrified! What if it has bugs? Or mold? Or something else I don't know about?	0 
Oh gosh_comma_ you also scared of bugs?? That's my worst fear	0 
Yes! I can't imagine them crawling on me when I sleep :/	0 
I would have a heart attack! 	1 
I remember eating my Baba's pierogies as a child_comma_ so yummy.	0 
I have no idea what those are!	0 
They are ukrainian pasta_comma_ kind of like stuffed pasta.	0 
oh ok. I like ravioli is it like that?	1 
I am so sad I have no pierogies.	0 
What are pierogies? a type of food?	0 
They are Ukrainian dumplings.	0 
Ah nice_comma_ I love dumplings_comma_ what are in them?	1 
The milk I drank this mornign went bad!	0 
That's no good_comma_ did you throw it out?	0 
Yes_comma_ but not before I drank some. :/	0 
Hope you don't get sick!  That would be a bad start to the weekend.	1 
I once had a fluffy cat named Leo_comma_ but he got lymphoma and I had to have him put to sleep.	0 
Oh_comma_ I am so sorry. It has to be the most difficult thing to have to do. I had to do that with my gorgeous lab - I still miss him!	0 
I'm sorry to hear about your lab as well. They are very sweet dogs.	0 
Indeed they are. And so are many cats - the farm I used to live on has a ginger tom. He's quite the character and used to visit me regularly!	0 
I love ginger cats! Leo was a ginger_comma_ and I have one right now named Chunk.	0 
This fella is called Oliver. He's a big old softie who is ace at catching gophers. He would bring half eaten ones to my door!	0 
Yikes! That doesn't sound pleasant_comma_ but I know they do that to try to show you they like you. They think you appreciate the gifts.	0 
Oh_comma_ I shouldn't be ungrateful_comma_ lol! At least he kills them before delivering them. A friends cat used to deliver live mice into the bathtub!	1 
I was so happy!  I have been working so hard for this company since I started so this is a great sign in my opinion!  	0 
Did you get a promotion?	0 
Not yet but I did get a raise!  If the company takes over I will get to be in charge of the helpdesk though!	0 
Wow_comma_ great job!	0 
Thank you! It's insane up here sometimes but I feel like I could be a good team lead.	1 
I'm really scared to go back to school.	0 
Oh no!  What has you scared?	0 
It's all new to me_comma_ I've never done it before	0 
It'll be okay I promise.  First few days will be weird but you'll slip in no problem once you adjust to your schedule.	1 
My mother died_comma_ I'm a mess.	0 
oh dang thats so horrible	0 
Thank you :(	0 
it gets better with time but it must be hard	1 
I really miss Hastings.  I spent so much time in that store when I first started college.  Both just hanging out and working.	0 
I remember that store! I loved going shopping there_comma_ was it your first job?	0 
It wasn't my first but it was my most favorite retail job I had	0 
Yeah_comma_ I bet_comma_ it looked like a fun place to work.  Especially for a college job.	0 
It really was.  It was so  laid back and chill.  I also made a ton of great friends there.	1 
I pray I can do well in school	0 
Are you having any specific problem areas?	0 
Not yet_comma_ but I haven't started yhet	0 
Okay. I hope you do well too.	1 
I've really wanted a Ford Excursion for a long time.	0 
Interesting_comma_ those things are huge_comma_ Do they even make them any more?	0 
They haven't made them for quite a few years.  But I met a guy that just picked one up in the last few days!	0 
Do you have a large family_comma_ or do you just like the idea of a large SUV?	0 
We don't have a huge family_comma_ just 5.  But my wife does daycare_comma_ and our current vehicle only has 5 seats_comma_ so she's stuck at home fairly frequently.	0 
5 is fairly large i would say. I hope you get your giant car one day.	0 
Thanks!  If not_comma_ we'll still manage just fine.  It would be nice_comma_ though.	1 
I'm scared to go to the cottage	0 
It is a big change. What is scaring you?	0 
I don't like bugs!	0 
I hate bugs too. You should exterminate before you move in	1 
I am sad my cousin is moving away.	0 
Is it really far?	0 
Yes_comma_ another country	0 
oh no. im sorry to hear that	1 
I had some friends over and went upstairs to my room.  All the lights were off and when I left my room a bat flew at me and landed on my leg.	0 
Well_comma_ that would be terrifying! Were you afraid that a vampire was there?	0 
Hahahaha_comma_ that piece hadnt crossed my mind although it should have with all the vampire movies I had seen!  I let out a scream and one of my friends captured the bat and let it outside to be free.	0 
Well_comma_ that would be very creepy! They would hear my scream in the next town over!	1 
I was totally ready for my garage sale	0 
You were ready? That's good to hear.	0 
Yes and we made $1026.25!	0 
Aweomse.  Treat yo self.gif	1 
I have an interview coming up.  Its for a position that someone else already has but I need to do this interview to get my name out there and let the higher ups know I want to move into management.	0 
Are you prepared?	0 
I am prepared for it.  I'll be a lot happier once it is over.	0 
I bet. Good luck to you	1 
I went to work the other day_comma_ and I was the only person in the office.	0 
Where you supposed to be there? If so_comma_ then that is a nice feeling.	0 
Yeah_comma_ everyone else was just gone.  It was nice for a while_comma_ but got a bit lonely.	0 
Oh I see. That could make the time go slow also. 	0 
It did toward the end of the day for sure!	1 
I am starting back at school next month. I am excited about getting back into my classes.	0 
That's great. What classes are you taking?	0 
I'm a computer science student. The one I'm most excited about is Microprocessors.	0 
That's pretty cool... Are you going to go towards hardware or stick with programming?	0 
I want to be a software developer I think_comma_ so I like the programming.	0 
You should go all out and get a EE degree to go with it.  You can do microprocessor design.	0 
I really like school_comma_ so you never know what I might decide to go for next. Thank you for the advice.	0 
Any time. Have a good weekend :D	1 
My dog just died in my arms.	0 
Did that happen tonight?	0 
No_comma_ it was a few years ago.	0 
Well_comma_ it must've been something you said.	1 
My step-daughter just turned 16 in the past week.	0 
Did she have a party?	0 
We're actually having it this coming weekend.	0 
Does she have her license yet?	0 
No . . . that's a long story involving her idiot father.  I'm somewhat glad_comma_ though_comma_ as she can't seem to set her phone down.	0 
Well_comma_ there's no hurry in driving_comma_ is there? What does she do mostly on her phone? Text??	0 
Text_comma_ video chat_comma_ watch some goofball put makeup on_comma_ and shop.  Things most teenagers do_comma_ I suppose.	0 
Does she play any sports?	1 
I watch my girlfriends dog every once in a while and she just isnt getting potty training.  She is a little over 5 months old and some weeks she does a great job and the next week she'll go to the bathroom everywhere but outside.	0 
That's super frustrating! I've only ever had outside pets so I can't really offer advice_comma_ but it's one of those things where your anger is all misplaced because you know you can't really be upset with the dog since it doesn't know any better.	0 
I do understand that part too.  I actually got a puppy a couple months before her so I went through this all.  I just wish her puppy listened as well as mine because he took a couple months as has been doing great since.  I know it'll click eventually...I just wish shed hurry up :)	0 
It'll be well worth it when she gets the hang of it_comma_ but urgh. Bathroom problems are why I don't think I want a kid anytime soon!	1 
I was shocked by my present.	0 
You got a present? How lovely! What was the occasion?	0 
It was my anniversary.	0 
Well_comma_ happy anniversary! What was your present?	1 
Humanity is the worst.	0 
I agree.. Did something happen?	0 
No_comma_ just frustrated	0 
I'm sorry.. Not everyone is bad.  Just a lot of people.	1 
My mom spent a lot of money buying me a computer for my birthday	0 
That was nice	0 
Yes_comma_ I love my mom and I will give her something even better for her birthday!	0 
Do you have anything in mind?	1 
My old roommate never did any dishes.  He also didnt wash any food off the plates so we had a sink full of dirty dishes and rotting food at all time.  It was miserable living there.	0 
So_comma_ I take you left to live someplace else?	0 
Haha yes_comma_ I ended up saving up then moving out and buying my own place.  I wont miss the flies sitting around the kitchen and he's still just as messy...now its on his own though instead of with other people.	0 
Just remember to never invite you ex-roomate to your new place_comma_ EVER!!!!!!	1 
I recently tried to get a manager's job in my company_comma_ two others and myself were the last three in the running for the job.	0 
Very nice_comma_ congrats on making it that far. I actually was in the same situation about a week ago.  How do you feel you match up to the others?	0 
I had much more experience than both of them_comma_ but ended up not getting the job. I am still pretty upset about it.	0 
I would be upset too.  However_comma_ I wouldnt get discouraged though.  There may be another opportunity even better that comes along soon.	1 
My little brother graduated not too long ago.  He had to work hard but he made it through college	0 
That's great_comma_ it's good to see people finish what they start. You must be very proud.	0 
I was.  I know how hard it was for him so it was great seeing that hard work pay off in the long run.	0 
Well_comma_ hopefully there will be nothing but great things for him in his future.	1 
My little brother graduated not too long ago.  He had to work hard but made it through it.	0 
I am so glad to hear that.  Did he find a job?	0 
He did!  He actually just started a new job that he loves and is related to his degree.	0 
That is good to hear.  What will he be doing?	1 
My girlfriend is moving in this weekend.  It will be great finally living together.	0 
Oh that's wonderful! How long have you two been dating?	0 
We have been dating almost a year.  I'm just excited to take this next step in the relationship.	0 
It's a huge step_comma_ congratulations! 	1 
My girlfriends aunt just died.  She wasnt close to her but is still devastated because of the impact it had on her sister.  I'm doing whatever I can to help them both.	0 
Sometimes deaths affect us even when we're not really close.	0 
Thats very true.  I know she feels bad for not keeping as close contact as she could have with her aunt now.	0 
Guilt can be a terrible thing to live with.	1 
My friend and coworker hasnt been coming into work.  People are starting to talk but its hard to stick up for him when he only comes in once or twice a week.	0 
Is he sick or just being lazy?	0 
A little bit of both.  He has bad anxiety but he also has told me he just doesnt like going into work.	0 
I hope he can get the help he needs and maybe a job he enjoys more.	1 
One time during Kindergarten_comma_ I peed myself because the teacher did not let me go to the restroom	0 
Oh_comma_ well that's awful on a little person! I never liked it when a teacher did that when a child needed to go to the bathroom!	0 
Thanks! Luckily I am potty trained now!	0 
LOL_comma_ well_comma_ that's good to know. So am I!	1 
One of my well knows patients that has horrible diabetes came in today for a follow up. 	0 
Is your patient improving an following good medical advice?	0 
Yes. After 3 years of working with her she finally started to take her medication as prescribed as well as watch her carb and sugar intake. I checked her blood sugar today and to my suprise it was normal!	0 
That would be a surprise.  A lot of people are not dedicated enough to change their condition_comma_ especially those with diabetes.	0 
I agree!. I was so proud of her and her test results surprised me! 	1 
The first time my girlfriend slept over I farted on her leg in the middle of the night.  She knew it happened but didnt say anything.  She also doesnt know that I know.	0 
Thats... uh... strange?	0 
It was embarrassing but I think that she stayed with me is after is a good sign!	0 
I think so_comma_ you're two peas in a pod.	1 
I'm trying to get some work done and my dog just wants to play!  I love him to death but he needs to learn to be independent at times too!	0 
Pets are great_comma_ but they can be a bit needy for attention at times. It is great_comma_ but not when you are busy and trying to get things done.	0 
Thats very true.  After our first conversation I might have to take a break and play with him a bit.  I might have to log off and go on a sort walk to tire him out.	0 
A walk will definitely help. He will probably be ready for a nap when you get back_comma_ then you can get some work done.	1 
One time when I was letting my cat outside_comma_ it ran out into the streets and got ran over	0 
Oh my god! That's terrible!	0 
Then I woke up_comma_ it was all a dream.	0 
Oh that's so great!	1 
my son just won first place at his championship swim meet!	0 
That's amazing!  Congratulations!  Swimming can be tough	0 
Thank you! He takes to it like a fish in water. HaHA!	0 
LOL I bet you use that line all the time!  I love it	1 
One time when using the public restroom_comma_ I had toilet paper hanging from my shoe when I went outside	0 
Oh man! I hope no one noticed. 	0 
Unfortunately I kept getting looks! It's alright though!	0 
I'm glad that it all worked out!	1 
I have a goal I want to get on here tonight but my dog really wants to play.  I feel bad that I'm not playing with him but would really like to hit my goal before I do.	0 
Oh_comma_ I bet you are really torn.	0 
I am_comma_ I would think I'll be done pretty soon and then take him for a nice long walk.	0 
I'm sure he will love that. I bet you will see the joy just shining in his eyes.	1 
My girlfriend broke up with me recently	0 
That's one of the hardest parts of life. What happened??	0 
We drifted apart it seems	0 
That is hard! Relationships are hard work.	1 
A friend of mine drove me to work when my car broke down	0 
That is great of them_comma_ did you do anything to pay them back?	0 
I took him out to dinner later on_comma_ he's a good friend	0 
That is nice of you_comma_ glad you have supportive friends!	1 
I saw a mouse run across my kitchen floor	0 
Aw poor mouse. I have had a few before..We actually rescued a few from our cat :/ 	0 
I hope I can catch it at some point	0 
They have live traps to catch and release that are only a couple bucks. Mice really are sweet natured.	1 
A co-worker of mine was late with work materials	0 
What happened to them?	0 
I eventually got them_comma_ but it almost cost me this project I've been working on	0 
Good_comma_ sorry you were inconvenienced_comma_ hope things get more consistent!	1 
I was watching my girlfriends son the other weekend and was trying to think of an activity we could do together.  I decided on cooking and got everything before he came over.	0 
that sounds like fun. for some reason kids really enjoy cooking.	0 
Yeah_comma_ he seemed to have a good time.  We made cheese too which was a first for both of us.  It turned out pretty good too which was nice.	0 
that sounds like fun. i want to try to make mozzerella	1 
I am nervous for my college test	0 
Did you study for it at least?	0 
I did but it is a law school exam. You just never know.	0 
That is true_comma_ well best of luck to you friend!	1 
I was walking around my office and someone spilled coffee on me	0 
That is bad. What did you do after that?	0 
I went to the bathroom to clean up_comma_ it was a new shirt as well	0 
Did he say sorry?	1 
When I came home_comma_ a TV show I had set to record was all ready to go	0 
What show was it?	0 
Black Mirror	0 
is that the one with Bryce Dallas Howard?	1 
I keep remembering my old college days	0 
Oh? What about them?	0 
Just how fun and carefree they were.	0 
That's true. Any memory in particular?	1 
I'm spending my first summer in Massachusetts. It's a lot hotter than I expected it to be.	0 
Is it really? How hot is it there?	0 
The hottest it got was 99 degrees. It has been in the mid 80s mostly_comma_ but I was expecting cooler weather in New England.	0 
That is hot_comma_ but it is a bit hotter where I live here	0 
I don't like it at all_comma_ but I can put up with it until fall.	1 
I was all alone when my family left for the weekend.	0 
Did you feel lonely_comma_ or were you happy to have some time to yourelf?	0 
A bit sad. More bored than anything.	0 
That is tough when you're not used to being alone.  What did you end up doing?	1 
I'm looking forward to meeting with some friends on the weekend	0 
Oh that's cool!  What do you all have planned?	0 
Probably go hiking and visit some local towns	0 
Well that sounds like a fun little trip.	1 
After a long day I finally got my dog settled down and I dont have any work.  It feels nice to just sit for a little bit.	0 
thats nice to be able to relax	0 
Have you had a good day?  Hopefully you dont have a busy weekend and can relax a little bit.	0 
everyday is a good day!	1 
I feel ready for the coming work week	0 
Really? You must really like you job then	0 
Yeah_comma_ I think I have all my work materials set	0 
Good for you! I hope you  have good week!	1 
I had an online interview today for a teaching position and I nailed it!	0 
Awesome! I am happy for you!	0 
Thanks! Regardless I am a bit nervous. There are a lot of things to remember and I don't want to look like a fool on the job.	0 
I am sure you will do fine! Good Luck!	1 
I found out recently that my girlfriend's cat has cancer and we cannot afford the operation to remove it.	0 
Oh I am so sorry. Best thing to do is be there for her.	0 
Thank you for your sympathies. Have you ever dealt with losing a pet?	0 
I have and it really hard. It just takes time But a good support system makes it way better.	0 
I'm happy to hear you were able to get through it over time.	1 
My girlfriend was having a bad day at work a few days ago.	0 
how did she handle it	0 
Well_comma_ I sent her some pizza and it was so unexpected it turned her whole day around!	0 
well that was nice of you	1 
I spent two hours studying material for an interview.	0 
did it help?	0 
Definitely. I aced it_comma_ and now I'm officially in a trial period!	0 
congrats! i hope it works out	1 
A while back_comma_ I intervened when I saw my dad was picking on my younger sister.	0 
That was good of you.  He didn't hurt her did he?	0 
No_comma_ but he was just being mean. So mean he decided to kick me out of the house.	0 
Oh no!!! Where did you end up going?	0 
To my girlfriend's place. Luckily it only lasted a week_comma_ and my Mom is super caring and loving. She took me back in against his wishes.	0 
That was so awesome of your mom :)	1 
Walking home alone from school one day_comma_ three young adults jumped in front of me and yelled in my face.	0 
Why did they do that?	0 
For no good reason; there are evil people in this world. I was so scared I cried on the way back home.	0 
That is terrible. Those days_comma_ a lot of people do stupid things.	1 
I wasn't sure how he would do since he didn't go to PreK.	0 
Children usually do really well_comma_ they are versatile. 	0 
I have heard that_comma_ but now I truly believe that!	0 
I hope he continues to do well.	1 
My daughter is officially all grown up she is leaving and going off to college next week. 	0 
Are you excited or will it be lonely? 	0 
In between I am very positive that she will be ok but just the thought of your first born going into the real world away from you is scary a little but I know she will be just fine. 	0 
Yeah that is scary. I am sure she will do great things though!	1 
My kids was away all summer I missed them like crazy when they was gone.	0 
I bet it was really quiet and lonely. Did you find some time for yourself though?	0 
A little to quite and I was very lonely I'm glad it's over lol I started isolating my self to much when they was away. 	0 
I don't think I would like that quiet either.	1 
I know I have high potential so the fact I failed my college course had me down.	0 
Well that's not good. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think maybe you were just too nervous during the test?	0 
The test and the whole semester I just didn't give it my all like I should have and now I feel really crappy and regretful I need to redo course and give it my all.	0 
Never be too confident! You've got to give life your all at every step.	1 
Some restaurants just have the worst workers they are so rude and mean to us the customers. 	0 
I agree. I dont know why they work in the service industry if they don't like to be nice	0 
Exactly what is even worse is the managers who are just as rude_comma_ I get so upset I had this happen to me at Wendy's staff was so unprofessional. 	0 
Fast food employees are the worst sometimes... it's like we bother them	1 
I will officially be a first time home owner next month. 	0 
How exciting!!!  I bet you are thinking already about  how you want to decorate it and fix up the lawn_comma_ etc..	0 
I am this is all I ever wanted for my family and it is about to come I am so thrilled with joy can't wait. 	0 
I can imagine!  It is certainly an exciting time.  I bet you are just over the moon happy!	1 
Do you have any experience about it	0 
Any experience with what?	0 
Anything that made you happy	0 
Yes some things	0 
can you share anything	1 
I packed a sandwich before I went to work	0 
Are you trying to save money by not eating out at work?	0 
Yup_comma_ and I am too lazy to drive out to a restaurant!	0 
Well_comma_ it can save you a bunch of money!  Plus you gain the time that you would normally spend going out somewhere and you can use that time to have more of a break.	1 
One time I saw poop smeared all over the public restroom	0 
Oh my! I bet you was so disgusted that you ran out of there. 	0 
Yup the smell was disgusting!	0 
Yikes! Why in the world would somebody do that?	1 
One time I looked at the mirror and thought I saw a monster	0 
Whoa! That is really scary! I've felt weird sensations like that before.	0 
Yeah. Unfortunately_comma_ it was a monster! I am just ugly!	0 
No! I'm sure you are not as monster-ish as you think!	1 
My mom spent a lot of money to buy me a computer	0 
Aw that's nnice of her	0 
Yup! She worked hard for like 3 weeks to save up for it! I love her!	0 
Moms are the best	1 
One time while I was camping_comma_ there was a giant rattle snake trying to attack us	0 
Did you kill the snake?	0

Surprisingly they he did_comma_ I guess sometimes we I need to trust people.	0

I had dumplings at a hotel yesterday_comma_ and for a hotel restaurant food they were actually good.	0

I got into an argument the other day with my 18 year old son.  I still feel badly about it	0 
Did you resolve things?	0 
Yes eventually_comma_ but I am sorry to admit that I said things I should have never said to him out of anger.	0 
I hope you can get over that pain.	0 
Thanks_comma_ me too.  I should have remained calm and not called him names and say things I didnt mean.	1 
One time I bought a scratch lottery ticket and won $20!	0 
That's awesome! It would be amazing to win a million one day. One can dream.	0 
Yup_comma_ I am going to buy another one just because of you! I hope I win!	0 
That's great. I hope you do! Maybe this time you can get $40. But gamble only in moderation!	1 
I was upset when my family kept leaving me on vacation	0 
That is really upsetting!	0 
It was. I just wanted some quality family time.	0 
Well forget them! If they don't care about you you don't need to care about them	1 
My cousin and I used to beat eachother with sticks.	0 
for fun?	0 
Yeah. We called it the box game and walked around inside of a refrigerator box for protection.	0 
well that sounds pretty fun!	1 
I was very well prepared for my law exam.	0 
Were you satisfied with the results?	0

I was grossed out when I saw someone vomit outside a bar.	0 
Drunk people can get pretty disgusting in general.	0 
For sure. it was not a pretty sight.	0 
Some people can't hold their liquor.	1 
Life is a lot better when you can eat solid food. Never get your jaw wired shut it sucks.	0 
I can imagine. What happend that you got your jaw wired?	0 
I got punched while drunk without a mouth guard years ago - still think about it !	0 
Man that sounds aweful.	1 
Life is good right now for me too	0 
Nice.  Always feels good to be at the top knowing nothing can't touch you	0 
Right just staying active_comma_ don't need much money_comma_ minimal drama. Easy	0 
Absolutely	1 
I used to feel lonely a lot as a teenager. That was dumb of me	0 
I feel like everyone goes through that phase.  I know I did too	0 
I've noticed that it's easier to be happy while not around someone all the time.	0 
Would you say you're more of an introvert?	1 
August is way too hot.	0 
Especially in the south	0 
Right. I live as north as you're gonna get in the US and it still sucks.	0 
Oh wow_comma_ that does sound horrible	1 
GED test was super easy. I was confident that I would pass it	0 
did you find out the results?	0 
Yeah I crushed	0 
dang thats awesome!	1 
Two years ago I decided to go back to school after working at my job for 12 years. At the time I was very nervous about my decision.	0 
Oh wow and you couldn't keep your job? What were you going to school for?	0 
I still work there_comma_ but just part time now. I am studying Computer Science.	0 
Oh wonderful! One of the best fields to be in right now	0 
I love it. Just ten more classes to go until I finish.	0 
Wow! Good luck_comma_ there are so many things you can do with that degree and from home too!	0 
Thank you! I hope to work from home.	1 
My grandparents have been married for 50 years I hope to be like that one day.	0 
That is awesome. I never even get a second date A husband may not be in the cards lol	0 
lol you just haven't came across the right person yet. It is incredible I arranged and had them a surprise dinner party it turned out very nice.	0 
Thats sweet. I bet they enjoyed it	1 
Here in Florida the traffic and wrecks is bad and always happening. 	0 
I hate bad traffic_comma_ did you get in an accident?	0 
Due to a reckless driver running the red light_comma_ but most wrecks I have witnessed come from careless drivers or drivers driving slow in the fast lane and get tail ended I get so irritated I swear. 	0 
That's the worst_comma_ I hate when people are careless.	1 
I get so angry when people stand me up it's so rude.	0 
I know what you mean	0 
My coworker did this recent we was suppose to have lunch she didn't call or anything. 	0 
that sucks. have you talked to her?	0 
Seen her at work but she has been avoiding me even more rude but never again will I plan an outing with her. 	1 
Professional settings is suppose to get along and be great but not my place of work staff fight like cats and dogs there. 	0 
That is awful.  I agree.  A professional setting is supposed to be ... well_comma_ professional.  What steps are being taken to correct that?	0 
We have a team building coming up and let's hope this works which I predict it will be some type of good outcome. 	0 
I agree.  I hope it will be.  Team building_comma_ communication_comma_ and professionalism will all help a company.  I think this is why so many companies fail.  	1 
I just drove 12 hours back from my parents' house. It wasn't so bad though_comma_ because I actually packed everything I needed for once. I was able to minimize the amount of stops I took and cut two hours off of the total time it took!	0 
Wow_comma_ you do really live far from your parents. Do you go to college or work?	0 
I work. We moved far from where they grew up when I was young_comma_ and they ended up moving back for retirement. 	0 
I see. Well_comma_ it seems as people get older they want to go back to places which reminds them of past. Nostalgia probably helps them cope with passing life	1 
I was pretty bummed to find out that my favorite coworker is transferring to a different department.	0 
I can see how that would be a downer.  Will you still get to see them?	0 
Once in a while_comma_ here and there.	0 
At least they aren't gone completely_comma_ but I can understand how that would affect your day to day work life.	1 
I prequalified for a mortgage last week online. The bank I applied with has called me 3 times a day ever since. I'm getting pretty frustrated.	0 
i would be really annoyed myself_comma_ why so many frequent calls ?	0 
I'm not sure. This is my first time shopping for a mortgage_comma_ so I'm not sure if it's normal or not.	0 
i know ever since i purchased a new car_comma_ i know for a fact i did not read the fine print but insurance companys call me almost every day multiple times a day _comma_ its really annoying 	1 
I watched Wimbledon for the first time last summer. Those tennis players are SO GOOD!	0 
I know right! my parents love tennis_comma_ so I grw up watching it.	0 
I had played a little bit growing up_comma_ but never watched it professionally. 	0 
were you ever any good at it?	1 
It was so life-like and I have such fond memories of playing in there.  My stepdad worked for pillsbury and brought home dough and I would pretend I was baking.	0 
Good for you to have such memorable experience to have and remember of. Can you bake now for real?	0 
Yes somewhat_comma_ although with all that practice in childhood I should be much better.   I miss my stepdad so much.   I have nothing but fond memories of him.	0 
Are you still in contact with him?	1 
I looked at a house I really liked last week_comma_ but just found out it was taken off the market.	0 
Oh that sucks. I hate when that happens.	0 
Yeah_comma_ it'll be okay though. There's always something else that will come available.	0 
I bet the next house you look at will be amazing and even better than that one.	1 
I had to drive 12 hours straight last week. For once it wasn't terrible_comma_ because I packed everything I needed. Took two hours fewer than it normally does!	0 
That sounds exhausting! Were you driving for work or just taking a vacation?	0 
Vacation. Went to go visit my parents.	0 
I'm sure the drives worth it since you get to spend time with the family.	1 
I came home from work_comma_ expecting an empty apartment. My boyfriend was home from his trip a day early!	0 
Was he alone?	0 
Yes_comma_ I was very excited to see him.	0 
Cool. Did you do something special?	1 
I got a promotion at work! I'm so excited!	0 
Congrats	0 
Thank you!	0 
Do you get a raise?	1 
My bank has called me three times a day for the past week_comma_ and I'm tired of it.	0 
Probably they noticed some irregular or even fraudulent activities associated with your account	0 
No_comma_ I prequalified for a mortgage_comma_ and they've been wanting me to speak to a loan specialist ever since.	0 
Are you interested in mortgage for now?	1 
My roommate leaves her leftovers in the fridge for a disgusting amount of time.	0 
Oh that is really gross! Have you talked to her about it?	0 
No_comma_ I don't feel like it's my place to tell her what to do.	0 
If you share the fridge_comma_ I'd let her know if it causes an odor or might affect the other food.	1 
I came home expecting an empty apartment_comma_ but my boyfriend had come home a day early from his trip!	0 
cool. did he have gifts?	0 
No_comma_ but I'm not big on gifts.	0 
Oh. I am lol	1 
Do you feel anything like that	0 
Like what? Bad or miserable?	0 
sad_comma_ when you see beggar in the street	0 
Yes indeed. Seeing people less fortunate than me makes go to pieces	0 
What do you think when you see them	1 
Next month my wife and I are going on our first vacation_comma_ I can hardly wait.	0 
Wow. enjoy your own time.	0 
I will_comma_ it is going to be great to get away together.	0 
Yeah_comma_ you're right. Hope you've memorable vacation.	1 
My ex boyfriend and I started having trouble getting along and we were under a lot of stress over money.   After awhile of this he started putting a password on his cell phone so I couldnt get in to see his messages.  THat was the first sign!	0 
Wao_comma_thats really not cool	0 
NO_comma_ not cool at all.  We ended up breaking up for a bit and he didnt waste any time before seeing this girl.   I wasted four years of my life for that to happen.   	0 
He doesnt deserve you_comma_so wipe your tears	1 
I found myself suddenly by myself and it seemed as if all the people I had become friends with were no longer wanting to still be friends.  I mostly met all of them through him when we got together_comma_ and when he left me he told them not to speak to me anymore and they listened.	0 
That's sad. But I'm sure they stil want to be firends with you too	0 
I dont think they do.  He was an abusive guy and he didnt want me to have them as friends and he would make up lies about me .  I dont think it was so much the lies he made up because they knew they were not true.  I think they were just loyal to him.	0 
Posibly. Sounds like you are better off without him though	1 
I love it when the buildbuilding is comingfrom me	0 
That's awesome_comma_ I wish I could build my own house.	0 
Is the conversation over? You are welcome then.	0 
Well thank you as well.	1 
Her name was Lily and she was a pit bull_comma_ my favorite breed.   I loved her so much.  We did everything together.  She would go wherever I did.	0 
Did she die recently?	0 
No she had to go to the humane society when my ex boyfriend and I broke up.   I had no choice_comma_ and he did it just to hurt me.  Lily would go swimming with me_comma_ ride on our boat etc.  When she was just a pup she would sit on my lap as i rode the four wheeler. 	0 
Oh wow! Thats so sad_comma_ I know animals can be like kids to use. I'm so sorry	1 
He was originally suspended at 17 when he again got got with a little bit of weed.  They have a law here in missouri called 21 and under law.  Automatically get suspended for a year if ur a minor in possession.	0 
That can ruin a persons life.	0 
I know it can which is why I was so worried at court.  THe judge looked at him and said son you need to hire you a lawyer.  I  throw people in jail for things like this.	0 
That is such a mess.	1 
The best thing happened at work today!	0 
Tell me more_comma_ sounds exciting! 	0 
Well we have these weekly meetings about our goals and today I was recognized by name in front of everyone for a job well done.	0 
Good on you! You finally got recognition for your hard work	1 
Ugh! Tonight was such a bummer.	0 
Oh no what happened?	0 
I was going to go to a concert but couldn't get myself to go by myself at the last minute. I feel like I'm going to regret not going.	0 
What concert was it?	0 
It was an annual block party we have here with a local lineup of musicians. I really liked the lineup!	0 
That probably would have been fun.	1 
The aftermath was awful.  Trash and debris was everywhere and we were homeless.  We lived out in the country and it took some time before red cross came out to do their report and get help to us.	0 
That sounds terrible. I hope you're okay now.	0 
I am doing better now but it was really hard times.  We had moved everything up higher as we never expected our whole house to go.  Unfortunately we had all our belongings in the house as well.	0 
Well all the matters is that no one was hurt. You can buy property again but not lives.	1 
I ordered a new phone last week_comma_ and when the box got here it was empty.	0 
That is so messed up!	0 
Yeah_comma_ I was pretty upset_comma_ especially when they initially refuse to refund my money.	0 
I would be so angry.	1 
A few years back I had to bury my dog_comma_ who had died at the age of 13.	0 
Oh wow_comma_ What kind of dog was it? I'm so sorry that must've been super hard	0 
He was a lab.  It broke my heart_comma_ to be honest.	0 
I can imagine. I haven't had an animal die yet but my cat is 13 and I'm dreading the day	1 
I thought I would never get the chance or opportunity to better my life as well as my childrens.  I cant wait till I get that degree	0 
That's wonderful that you are pursuing a degree. What is it in?	0 
I am getting a counseling degree to help abused women.  I feel I would make a good counselor since I  have been in a few abusive relationships myself.	0 
That is great that you have been able to overcome and do this to help others. You can really make a difference! 	1 
I saw a video game trailer recently that really brought me back!	0 
Yeah? Which game was it for?	0 
The new Spyro Remastered game coming out. Seeing it really reminded me of how I used to play the original all day with an old friend of mine.	0 
Nice. The original Spyro is a classic.	1 
I had a flat on the way to work this morning_comma_ and the jack handle was missing from my car.	0 
Oh no. What did you do?	0 
I used a screwdriver to work the jack. It sucked_comma_ lol.	0 
Lol_comma_ well done for attempting it. Did you make it to work on time?	0 
Yep_comma_ with 5 minutes to spare. (No pun intended)	1 
I just celebrated my birthday and it was so much better than usual.	0 
That's great. What made it so special this year?	0 
I usually don't do much to celebrate but this year a friend of mine got all my other friends together to throw a party for me without me knowing. It was a great time.	0 
Sounds like fun! I'm glad you had a happy birthday.	1 
My wife and I have tried to have a baby for over three years_comma_ and had given up hope.  Two weeks ago_comma_ we found out she was pregnant.	0 
I am so happy for you! Congrats!	0 
Thank you!  We were both pretty shocked by the news_comma_ lol.	0 
I wish you nothing but the best!	1 
I was in an extremely dangerous abusive relationship at the time and I knew he was intending to put her in the middle of it all.   He intended to use her for leverage over me .	0 
It sounds like you're talking about two different people there instead of just one person.  I'm a little confused.	0 
Oh my I am getting ahead of myself.  I was referring to when I had to put my daughter emerson up for adoption in 2011.  	0 
Ouch that sucks. I'm sorry to hear that.	1 
Ugh! My friend is definitely getting on my nerves today.	0 
Why what happened? Are y'all on a trip?	0 
We made plans to catch up but never set a time. I tried to contact him to figure out what time and he never got back to me. I was looking forward to catching up.	0 
Oh wow_comma_ so he basically ghosted you? I would be mad too	1 
Yes_comma_ I pray not to be found or trapped like they trapped me to stab unknown man.	0 
That sounds very bizarre.	0 
Serious_comma_ that has being my worse situation so far	0 
I hope you are okay.	1 
My car window was broken when i walked up to my car this morning!	0 
That is so messed up!	0 
Yeah it is! Im going to have to spend money I didnt have. Im so upset right now.	0 
I hope this doesn't happen again.	0 
I agree. I have never felt this frusterated in a long time! I should go for a walk	1 
I really felt like a fool last night.	0 
Oh my_comma_ what did you do_comma_ may I ask?	0 
I was playing a board game with a few friends and I ended up spilling my entire drink all over the table. 	0 
That does not sound good. It must have been so embarrassing!	1 
Work was not a good experience today.	0 
Oh no_comma_ what happened?	0 
I had to explain how a bunch of things work in front of a lot of people. I'm not a fan of talking in front of a crowd.	0 
I hate public speaking too!	1 
When i moved to dallas I felt I would have the time of my life after living in a small town_comma_ but after a couple of weeks i got homesick.	0 
Dallas is a really fast city.	0 
yeah it is. I dont know anybody and my classmates all have jobs. so I get to be at home by myself alot	0 
I'm sorry_comma_ things will get better.	0 
thank you. i wish i havd more friends here. 	1 
I'm really excited about this weekend!	0 
What are your plans?	0 
A friend of mine has been out of the country for a year and he has finally come back. We're going to catch up.	0 
Thats aweosme! Is he going to be staying with you?	0 
Yep_comma_ we have all weekend to hangout!	1 
So my sister drove my car to run an errand and got a ticket! She doesnt have her license	0 
That is terrible. What happened then?	0 
Well not much. Its just I feel bad because I told her I would take her but got so busy. Maybe im the one that should have got the ticket. not her	0 
I understand. My mistaske always happened.	0 
I agree. Its my fault she will have this fine. I will have to pay it for her now . 	1 
Financial troubles are sometimes the worst! Ugh.	0 
Those are so stressful. Just take it step by step and you can get on track. 	0 
You really have to. Luckily_comma_ my family was able to help me out and get me back on my feet. It's definitely nice to have people who are willing to help.	0 
That makes all the difference. I am glad you were able to get out of that position. 	1 
so my brother will be the first out of 4 kids of my parents to have a baby and today is going to be the gender revealing party. 	0 
You must be really excited for it! Do you think its going to be girl or boy?	0 
we all want a boy so we are all cant wait to find out what it is. everyone is so impatient about it_comma_ but today is the day.	0 
Well_comma_ it will great either way as long as the baby is healthy! 	0 
I agree!. I cant wait to get there to find out. lol	1 
I'm looking forward to how chill this weekend will be.	0 
Do you plan do something this weekend?	0 
Quite the opposite_comma_ really. I just paid all my bills and have not really any plans. Sometimes it's nice to just not have that stress and relax.	0 
Yes. It is sometime nice to just rest at home.	1 
So this year will be the first time I been to a haunted house. Im get scared easilty so Im kinda worried. I promised my friend I would go with her. 	0 
That sounds like fun Do you know who haunts it?	0 
I dont know_comma_ but I feel I should not go_comma_ but again I promised my friend I would go. I dont know wha to do now. 	0 
Well_comma_ if you promised I would try to go. I'm sure it'll be fine. 	0 
I agree. I will think about it for now. I'm very scared something will happen so im debating. 	1 
Me and this girl have been dating for awhile now_comma_so I think Im going to ask her to be my girlfriend. 	0 
Nice! You must be pretty confident she will say yes.	0 
Yes I agree. I feel that way about it. You know me too well. 	0 
I hope it goes well for you and brings happiness to you both.	0 
Thank you. I hope she dont say no_comma_ but i can bet you she says yes. 	1 
My sister's cat got sick and had to be put down last week. Feels bad.	0 
That sounds terrible. But hopefully it isnt suffering any more. 	0 
She had stomach cancer_comma_ so she was in a lot of pain. Definitely the right thing to do	0 
I agree_comma_ just remember her for all the good memories. 	1 
I have a huge exam coming up tomorrow.	0 
Have you been studying? That is intimidating but I bet you'll do great! What's the subject?	0 
It's for a PC Architecture class. I'm feeling really good about it though since I studied really hard all week!	0 
What an interesting course! I hope you do really well. Exams can be so scary- they can cause such anxiety. 	1 
There are maggots all over my building's garbage bin this morning. I got one on my arm when I walked by	0 
That is very bad. Did you complaint to the landlord?	0 
They don't care. They live upstairs and are very dirty people. I'm moving as soon as I get a job!	0 
I understand. The best thing is to move.	1 
Coming home driving in the rain my car hydroplaned on the freeway!	0 
That's awful! I'm always scared that's going to happen to me when it's raining	0 
I agree and thank god I was the only car on the freeway _comma_ otherwise It would be a different story!	0 
You got lucky for sure!  I can't imagine how scary that would be	0 
Yah im very thankful to be here right now! whew!	1 
I'm amazed on how many people came to the parade considering the rain!	0 
Really_comma_ where was this parade at? I'm in Missouri and it was absolutely pouring on Friday	0 
I'm here down south and It has been pouring as well_comma_ but that didnt stop people from coming! Im shocked. 	0 
I usually don't let a little rain stop me unless it's ridiculous!	0 
I agree! They even brougth their kids! its so baffling!	1 
I just saw a commercial about the Rescue Animals. Everytime I see it it makes me so sad. 	0 
oh no. feeling empathy towards them just shows you're normal. There's a lot of people in your boat	0 
Yea. It reminds me of my old dog that was a rescue. So many memories. I want to go get one actually. 	0 
whats preventing you?	0 
I started nursing school and work full time_comma_ so I wont give much time to it. I want it to be a happy dog. 	0 
you sound too kind. You'd be a great dog mother/father!	0 
Thank you! Im gonna have to not see them commercials anymore_comma_ otherwise I will cry 	1 
I love mystery boxes in games! Unfortunately I usually don't get anything good.	0 
That sounds fun!  What are they exactly?	0 
Almost any game that has an online component! Like right now I play The Secret World and it has mystery boxes.	0 
It sounds like you really enjoy it!  Good for you!	1 
So I will be going to see my mom after 2 years of not seeing her since starting school! I cant wait	0 
How exciting! She must be thrilled too	0 
Yes she is. We are all so excited to finally hang out! We have so much planned	0 
I hope you guys have the best time!	0 
Thank you! WE will make the best of it !	1 
So the role I worked so hard for went to a person who could care less about the play! 	0 
That unfortunate.  Are you feeling a little jealous?	0 
I guess you can say that! What a day!	0 
I hate it when stuff like that happens. 	0 
I agree. Maybe I will act like him next time. 	0 
Haha_comma_ nooooo... don't do that.   There are too many of those people in the world as it is.	0 
Yeah your right. I will stick to my little envious rant and go about my day	0 
Sounds like the best course to me :)	1 
Once_comma_ I went camping with my family. We saw many animals and a beautiful creek. It was a happy time.	0 
That sounds so great. Being in nature makes you feel so good. 	0 
It does! I really hope we get to go camping again this fall.	0 
You should just make a plan and do it. It sounds like it is worthwhile. 	1 
We order Chinese food last. The order was completely wrong but the lady seemed very helpful when we called.	0 
That sucks_comma_ sorry to hear that. Did you get a refund?	0 
We didn't get a refund but they were able to fix the order. I was really craving Chinese!	0 
Hopefully they get your order correct the next time you order there!	1 
I ate a lot of my kid's Halloween candy. I told her the candy was old and I had to throw it away.	0 
Did it taste good?	0 
It was really good! She had a lot of candy. I was hoping she wouldn't notice some missing!	0 
Did it taste good?	0 
Yes it did!	1 
two weeks back i celebrated my birthday and do you know what my office colleagues planed for me	0 
Were you suprised that they did this for you?	0 
yes and i am quiet happy that they also brought my wife who stays in london for party to surprise me	0 
Wow! How happy you must be. I be that day brought you lost of excitement. 	0 
yes it took me with a surprise how well my colleagues planned for me	0 
You must have great co workers. I bet your happy everyday you go to work	1 
So my childhood dog died last week. My mother called me with the news. 	0 
oh so sad _comma_ what happened to it	0 
He died of old age. He could barely walk so they put him down. Yeah pretty bad news. It made my day blue	0 
it must must a very much hard time for you and your family 	0 
Yes it is. He is in a better place now. 	0 
yes _comma_ he be rest in peace	1 
We went camping in the mountain. We did not know it was bear season. There were a lot of hunters and hunting dogs in the area. They were chasing the bears into one area	0 
I would be so scared. I think I might have to leave. Did the bears bother anyone?	0 
Luckily_comma_ the hunters kept them around a mile from camp. It was still very hard to sleep! We heard dogs barking at the bears all night!	0 
Were you in a tent or a camper? I hope you kept your food locked up tightly.	0 
We were in a tent and all of food was in a Yeti! I made sure everyone put their food away and burned leftovers in the fire.	0 
Glad everyone is safe! You were very smart.	1 
We had a doberman for over 8 years. He passed away last spring. It was a hard time for our family.	0 
Oh_comma_ I'm so sorry to hear that. I know pets can be like one of the family. 	0 
They are like having another child! I hope to have another doberman one day. They're really good dogs.	0 
You should adopt a rescue dog. That would be great for the family. 	0 
That's a great idea!	1 
last week i visited a restaurant and found a insect in the burger which i ordered	0 
That's disgusting. What did you do about it?	0 
i immediately raised an alarm about the issue and complained to store manager	0 
Did you get a refund at least? I would never visit that restaurant ever again if I were you!	0 
yes they provided me a 100 dollar gift card too	1 
We have homeschooled our daughter for the past 3 years. This year_comma_ she has decided to return to public school.	0 
That's interesting! Most kids love being home-schooled but I guess she missed socializing and interacting with her peers.	0 
She did miss having a lot of friends. I hope she does well. She starts in 10 days!	0 
Not too much longer! I hope she adjusts well and enjoys herself. Public school can still provide an enriching experience when it comes to social skills and education.	1 
This will be my last semester in college! I cant wait to finish.	0 
Wow good job! SO close	0 
THanks!. I get so happy everytime I think about it!	0 
Thats a great accomplishment	0 
I agree. My family will be proud of me! 	1 
Since I moved to dallas I have not met any friends. I go to work and school and just come home. 	0 
maybe you should job a club or a social gatherings group	0 
I agree. It gets boring at home alone with no one. 	0 
i agree. you need to socialize a little bit to get out of your lonely slump	0 
I agree. This weekend it is! 	0 
that should be fun. good luck!	1 
My sister lives in Utah. We had planned for her to come visit but her work would not allow her to take the time off.	0 
Aw that's annoying. Work always gets in the way of things. Did you ever try to go to her?	0 
I haven't yet. I would like to eventually. I'm hoping to see her soon	0 
I'm sure it will work out! Not this time unfortunatly_comma_ but it will in the end	1 
So I was out of town this weekend and lent my brother my car. I was hesitant at first_comma_ but I felt he would do good with it and take care of it. 	0 
Did he take care of it for you?	0 
He did. I feel I can let him use it more often after this. 	0 
That is great that he was able to show you he is responsible. I bet you're proud. 	0 
Yes I am. I can know rest assure that he will do good. 	1 
My husband works very hard so that I can be a stay at home mom. It has allowed me the freedom to homeschool our daughter.	0 
That's awesome_comma_ what does your hubster do?	0 
He owns an auto repair shop. He works from sun up to sun down!	0 
Wow_comma_ I admire his dedication! And you won't ever have to worry about your vehicle breaking!	0 
That's is the number one perk of having a mechanic for a husband!	1 
So my 1 year review at work is coming up and I feel its going to be good since I wokred so hard. 	0 
Hard work pays off in the long-run. If your work is truly authentic in its nature_comma_ it is definitely going to be recognized and appreciated	0 
I agree. I think my raise will be good as well as the promotion I asked for. 	0 
Be careful while negotiating your pay raise. Some managers may find it too intrusive and that may leave bad impression on them	0 
Sounds like a plan! She has noticed my work _comma_ so im confident it will work out well. 	1 
My child sneaked in my room to get the Xbox controller while I was sleeping. The night before_comma_ I had grounded her.	0 
Oh no_comma_ do you think she was trying to get back at you for grounding her?	0 
I think she thought she could play a few minutes of Minecraft and then return the controller before I woke up! I caught her getting into the drawer where I hid it.	0 
I definitely remember trying something like that when I was a kid.  I think sometimes kids think they're sneakier than they actually are.	1 
My friend came to my house drunk and threw up everywhere. 	0 
Whow!  That sounds really disgusting!  What did you do?	0 
Yes it was! I could not do nothing. She was in a raging fit. Ijust made she she went to sleep ok. 	0 
Man_comma_ you are a good friend!  I would have been beyond angry!	0 
I am! I'm more grossed out about it than anything!	1 
My friends mother got diagnosed with cancer last month and its been hard on her. 	0 
So sorry to hear that. It is truly horrifying and i wish and hope for nobody to be hit with this calamity	0 
Yeah. Shes my best friend_comma_ so I'm planning to go with her this weekend to see her mom. my heart breaks for her..	0 
Indeed. Friends should be together in times of need. That is what friends are for	0 
I agree! Thank you!	1 
Last week I did a presentation at work and as I stood up I blew some gas!	0 
oh no!! Did anyone notice? it's normal though_comma_ we all do that sometimes	0 
Yes it was loud. I can feel my face turn red and the room getting quiet!	0 
oh man... It happened to me before_comma_ i know how embarrassing it is.	0 
Yes it was. Ugh!	1 
So my little brother barely passed his finals to become a cop! I could not beleive it. 	0 
That's great that he passed though!  ARe you happy about it?	0 
Im very happy_comma_ but all he do through school was party and never study. Im shocked. 	0 
Well at least he passed - that's great!	0 
Yes it is. Im happy for him.!	1 
We went to the library where they had an animal expert stop by for the kids. My daughter was able to answer most of his questions that other kids could not. It made me smile.	0 
That is pretty neat actually. I wish i had kids to bring to stuff like that.	0 
You should check your local library. The ones in my area have tons of things_comma_ like a Lego club_comma_ for the local kids.	0 
I will do that_comma_ i had no idea.	1 
My dad died of cancer in 2012. That was really hard for me emotionally.	0 
I'm really sorry to hear that.	0 
Thank you. I was prepared_comma_ but it was still difficult.	0 
I can't even imagine to be honest.	0 
I hope you don't have to go through it for a long time.	0 
I have lost grandparents and greatparents but they were all older in age so it was easier to deal with.	0 
It's always tough_comma_ even if someone is older.	0 
I'm sure it will be different when it's a parent.	1 
I have a performance review and potential promotion coming up in the next few weeks.	0 
that's awesome! I hope you will get a promotion. what do you do for work?	0 
I work as an accountant for a carpet cleaning company. There is a chance that I could be made a manager!	0 
You will be a great manager! Good luck with everythig	1 
I just hired a new hotel inspector_comma_ he has very little experience but wants to learn. Scares me.	0 
you took a risk huh? i hope he will be a great worker! That's good you gave him a chance	0 
Yes_comma_ I need more staff member and he was very nice. But if he does a bad job I get fired.	0 
i hope it won't happen! 	1 
In high school_comma_ I fell down the stairs in front of my crush. My face turned red and I ran away!	0 
Oh no! Did he say anything about it?	0 
He laughed at me. Looking back_comma_ I'm sure it was funny but in the moment_comma_ I could have died!	0 
I know what you mean. I've done stuff like that too - you do feel a bit silly_comma_ don't you!	1 
Last night I won a gift card at Trivia night at the pub. Going shopping today.	0 
Awesome! What are you planning on buying?	0 
I've got a baby due in December so something for the baby or my wife. I never bother getting my self anything.	0 
Maybe you can figure out a way to get all three of you guys something!	1 
I found out my wife was dating someone else a year before we got married_comma_ we were together for 7 years at that point. Today I'm stressed!	0 
Oh no that is crazy!	0 
Yea_comma_ We have a baby due in December so I'm trying to not jump to any decisions to quickly.	0 
Well I'm sorry you are going through this and I hope you can figure it all out. 	0 
Thanks_comma_ everything happens for a reason. 	1 
I woke up one morning to make a sandwich. The smell of the sandwich meat made me sick! I felt something was wrong and drove to the nearest store. I purchased a pregnancy test.	0 
I hate those things_comma_ i try to not eat those at all.	0 
I usually love eating sandwiches which is why I knew something just wasn't right! I was experiencing morning sickness!	0 
I eat steak and shrimp.	1 
I have a friend that will not stop talking about himself. He always wants to talk about his latest investments_comma_ the books he has read_comma_ and how much he knows about the places that he visits!	0 
i really dislike snooty people who are constantly rubbing their amazing life in your face.	0 
I do too. It makes me not want to be around those types of people.	0 
i wouldn't be friends with someone like that. i mean what can you benefit from that friendship?	0 
Exactly! I should really stop hanging out with him.	0 
agreed. you really won't be missing out on anything worthwhile.	1 
I am a big Taylor Swift friend! 	0 
I love Taylor Swift! She's talented and beautiful!	0 
Yes I need to arrive at her concert tonight at  8!	0 
How exciting for you! Have fun!	1 
I know I studied well_comma_ but I can't stop worrying about it. 	0 
You have a test coming up?	0 
Yes on Friday. It is the final.	0 
Well I hope you do well! Good luck.	1 
She had a lot  of friends that came.	0 
That's interesting. What was she doing?	0 
She had her birthday at Chuck E Cheese.	0 
That's awesome! I didn't know that place was still in business. 	1 
I love to coupon but sometimes I feel like the cashiers aren't trained properly. They will look at the coupon for every detail and do not understand the language in the fine print.	0 
Yeah I bet it is frustrating. The store gets reimbursed for the coupons so they should not nitpick.	0 
I agree. It's not like the money will come out of their paycheck if something is wrong!	0 
I hope they get better training so you don't have to argue with them about it	1 
The cop said he was too old!	0 
Too old for what? What a strange thing to say.	0 
Too old to give him a ticket for reckless driving! 	0 
That doesn't make much sense. Maybe I am missing the context.	0 
That's what I thought! 	1 
I played a game of poker with a friend who had no idea what he was doing. I won about $100 from him that night.	0 
Oh no_comma_ he shouldn't have gambled. 	0 
You are probably right! I felt bad when I was spending the money. I hope he didn't really need it.	0 
I would've too_comma_ but sometimes people need to learn a lesson.	0 
This is very true!	1 
Recently there have been a few break ins.	0 
Oh no! Did you property get broken into? Or your neighbor's property?	0 
No_comma_ my neighbor did but that's close enough for me! 	0 
For real! Are you taking any precautions?	1 
One time I saw a stray dog walking around a restaurant looking for food	0 
Inside the restaurant ? What kind of place was this ?	0 
It was outside a fried chicken chain restaurant	0 
Okay_comma_ that makes more sense then to me.	1 
We made sure to board up for the hurricane coming.	0 
Where are you located ?	0 
We are in Miami_comma_ Florida 1 mile from the beach. .	0 
I wasn't even aware there was a hurricane.	1 
The cop said I will probably never find out who did it. 	0 
Who did what?	0 
I wont find out who the person was that hit my car while I was sleeping.	0 
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. People are so inconsiderate!	1 
My sons teacher isn't very nice to the young kindergartners. 	0 
Oh no! Why not?!	0 
Not_comma_ sure_comma_ but she is not very nice at all.	0 
I would make a complaint to the principal if I were you!	1 
I may never know who she was.	0 
Never know who was?	0 
The women that hit my car and left before the police came.	0 
Wow that is aweful! 	0 
I agree. And the cop said I will probably have to pay for my own damage! 	1 
Near my house_comma_ there is an abandoned school that is said to be haunted. When I was a teenager_comma_ a group of friends and I decided to go check it out.	0 
Oh wow_comma_ what happened?	0 
When we pulled up_comma_ it was very spooky. I didn't even want to get out of the car! A few of my friends tried to get in but it was boarded up. I looked in the window and there was still writing on the chalkboards!	0 
That would give me the creeps! Has anyone seen anything there?	0 
There are stories about ghosts of children walking through the hallways and that you can hear laughing. We didn't see or hear anything supernatural but it was still scary!	0 
I bet it was. I've only had one creepy experience - that was in an old house in West Virginia. I'm very careful to avoid those places these days!	1 
My hair has always been long and I had been scared to have a short hair cut. Last December_comma_ I finally took the plunge and cut off all of my hair.	0 
Good for you! There is nothing wrong or uncool about short hair.	0 
That's what I have discovered! I get a lot of compliments on it and I feel really good about myself when I go out!	0 
Great! I'm glad that it worked out well for you!	1 
I recently drove back to my hometown and went to the towns fair_comma_ it felt so nice reliving my childhood.	0 
That's awesome_comma_ I went to visit my parents and my hometown last month_comma_ it is a great feeling.  How was the fair?	0 
It was great_comma_ it didn't change much but it still has that 'soul' to it. Just felt great looking at it honestly.	0 
Brings back all the memories you had as a kid.  I miss going to the state fair_comma_ was always fun.	1 
When I was in high school_comma_ I dated a guy for almost a year. A few weeks before summer_comma_ he broke up with me and started seeing another girl.	0 
You must have been sad and angry.	0 
I was. I would get really mad when I saw them at lunch or after school together. I was my first experience with heart break.	0 
Yes first heart brake is so hard_comma_ I feel for you_comma_ something similar happened to me with my first boyfriend.	1 
This was my first time winning a contest on the raido!	0 
That's awesome! Congratulations!	0 
Thanks! I will get to go free to the Taylor Swift concert tonight! 	0 
No way! That's actually a super awesome prize! Have fun	1 
I bought extra items during school lunch in high school. I have a negative balance on my account.	0 
Ouch_comma_ hopefully its not by much. I remember when i was in high school i had a similar situation. They're usually pretty lenient on it.	0 
I had to take money out of my dad's wallet to cover it. I would have got in so much trouble with my parents for buying candy! It wasn't much but I still felt bad.	0 
I'm sure your dad wouldn't mind haha_comma_ its usually pretty cheap anything i remember they cost like $1.	1 
I had a roommate in my dorm who didn't clean up his dorm room at the end of the semester and the school fined me and the other two roommates $100. I was furious at that guy.	0 
Did you try to get the money from him? He sounds like a pretty bad person.	0 
Yeah we tried but he cut all communication_comma_ he didn't respond to his phone number or anything. I hope he got fined a larger amount so it teaches him a lesson on laziness. 	0 
I do too! People like that make me never want to have a roommate! 	1 
So i recently traveled to Cuba to see some friends and we went to a bar until 3 AM_comma_ and as we were walking back there were these 3 guys hiding in the shadows. We got so scared we started running but thankfully they didn't follow.	0 
Oh wow. That's pretty scary. I would be horrified.	0 
Yeah it was quite an experience_comma_ my friends said those are usually drunk people who stay up the whole night talking with people. But they looked like they wanted to do more than talk!	0 
Well_comma_ at least they didn't follow you. How is Cuba? My parents are from there but I've never been.	0 
Its great_comma_ very beautiful and amazing culture (and food!). Just don't drive if you go_comma_ they seriously drive like maniacs haha	1 
I raised 6 chickens since they were babies. I was trying to let them free range but I forgot to put them back in their coop for the night. A predator was able to get to them.	0 
Oh no! That's sad_comma_ did he get them all?	0 
Yes_comma_ it did! I think it was a dog that always gets out of our neighbor's yard.	0 
Aw_comma_ that's too bad_comma_ hopefully next time they will be safe in the coop!	1 
I was looking through old clothes that i was giving away and found $40 in one of the back pockets. Made me very happy lol	0 
wow_comma_ so what are you going to do with it?	0 
Oh i just put it into a little piggy bank i have_comma_ trying to get to $220 to cop some yeezys that are coming out in october. Hope i get a pair!	0 
nice_comma_ i hope that works out for you... good luck	1 
I was watching youtube and saw this guy eat a jellyfish straight out of the ocean. Looked like the most disgusting thing someone could eat.	0 
That is gross_comma_ I can't even imagine what that would taste like!	0 
He said it had the texture of hard rubber and tasted of pure algae and just dead stuff. He even ate another one that he pan-fried and it was all green and moldy.	0 
That's so gross_comma_ I would take a hard pass on eating that. I like seafood but that's too much.	1 
One of my friends jumped from the roof of his house to the pool and somehow made it_comma_ it was like 10+ feet of distance_comma_ really amazing stuff.	0 
Omg_comma_ Thankfully he wasn't hurt. 	0 
Yeah i was really nervous that he was gonna get hurt since he likes to do stupid dares. It was quite the experience.	0 
Did yall happen to get it on video? 	0 
No sadly_comma_ nobody had their phones with them at the moment. But theres plenty of videos on youtube showing what happens if you dont make it!	1 
My older brother is getting married Friday.	0 
Congrats!_comma_ I'm sure you must be very happy!	0 
I am very happy for him! I thought it was never going to happen!	0 
Haha brotherly love_comma_ I hope him and the lucky gal have a wonderful life together!	1 
Having a kid can be one of the most happy moments in a person's life. I cannot express how much happiness my daughter has brought to us since she was born.	0 
thats amazing i cant wait to have my own one day	0 
It can be hard but it's one of the best experiences that I have had in life.	0 
i bet so!	1 
im nervous for the new week to begin	0 
Is there something that is making you nervous about the upcoming week?	0 
very busy and lots of traveling	0 
That can be stressful. I am sure that every thing with go smoothly for you! Just remember that the weekend is only 5 days away! 	1 
I spent 10 minutes looking for my car keys while my friends waited outside and they were in my pockets the whole time. My friends made sure i never forgot that moment haha	0 
We all do stuff like that. At least you didn't lock them inside your car. Done that before!	0 
Oh thankfully i've never had to go through that yet. That one would really suck!	0 
Yeah nothing like calling the locksmith and admitting you are not very bright. Haha.	1 
I told her I had to work because I didn't want to go see a movie tonight.	0 
Did you not want to go out_comma_ or did you just not like the movie?	0 
I was tired and wanted to get in bed early_comma_	0 
Just be careful with that. If you feel tired due to stress_comma_ it may be the stress talking and not you.	1 
Had my finals last week_comma_ studied really hard for them. Felt so nice walking into that room so confident and calm	0 
Great_comma_ when will you know your scores?	0 
Thankfully i knew them right at the spot_comma_ i got a 98!	0 
Wow_comma_ that's fantastic.	1 
He doesn;t seem to see the issue.	0 
Who doesn't?	0 
My husband doesn't see flirting with girls a problem. 	0 
What a jerk! That is definitely a problem!	1 
I studied all week for my math finals and only scraped a 68 on it.	0 
That's a real bummer. Do you at least pass the class?	0 
Yeah_comma_ passed with a 75_comma_ not what i wanted but at least i passed	0 
Well at least you don't have to take it again. Could have been worse.	1 
i dropped my groceries in the parking lot	0 
Oh no_comma_ how awful for you! I hope people helped you to pick them up (and didn't help themselves!).	0 
i grabbed the cans that rolled away_comma_ lol	0 
Glad you find humor in it! I dropped a bottle of water once_comma_ which rolled under the car. I was livid!	1 
One of my roommates left without cleaning his room and the school charged me and my roommates 100$ each	0 
That's extremely frustrating! What were they expecting you to do? It's not your fault your roommate left it trashed.	0 
Yeah thats what we told them but they showed us the paper saying that its one of the rules. We were so furious at that guy_comma_ worst thing is he never responded to our calls or texts. Really immature and selfish of him.	0 
Well_comma_ I guess the good news is that he no longer lives with you. But that blows_comma_ how hard is it to clean up after yourself before you leave?	1 
A restaurant that I wanted to eat at had "call ahead seating" where you can call and get placed on a waiting list. I called ahead and was told we would have a table in 10 minutes. When we arrived 10 minutes later_comma_ our table was not ready!	0 
That is so annoying. They should not call it that if they can't guarantee 10 minutes.	0 
That's what I told the hostess. There was no point in calling ahead if we still have to wait 45 minutes for a table.	0 
Hopefully the food was at least worth the wait. I would have been annoyed as well.	0 
The food made it worth the wait_comma_ for sure! Any other restaurant I would have walked out!	1 
We had a new puppy. He loved to chew on everything. I went to the grocery store and when I got back home_comma_ the puppy had pulled the cushions off of the couch. He had chewed through the bottom!!	0 
Oh god! I haven't had a puppy in a long time_comma_ but you forget all the things in your house that are not puppy-proof. They find ways to make messes in the most creative ways.	0 
They do! I'm really glad that that stage didn't last too long in him. I just hated having to buy an entire new living room suite! Puppies are expensive.	0 
Yeah_comma_ that's a real headache. I'd want to say they're worth it_comma_ but on that day I wouldn't be so sure_comma_ haha.	1 
I accidentally dropped my phone at the screen started to glitch out and didn't want to turn on anymore. I was scared because it was a brand new phone. Thankfully after a while of it just sitting there it turned back on normally.	0 
That is a huge blessing_comma_ I don't know about you but my life is pretty much keyed into my phone.	0 
Same here_comma_ they're so incredibly important in this day and age.	0 
It's almost a shame how much we depend on them_comma_ but I know I'd be lost without mine.	1 
i am bothered by my neighbors loud power tools next door	0 
Do they run them all day long - or at night?	0 
during the morning and day on the weekends!	0 
Is there any kind of noise ordinance in your area?  I know in ours unless they are still running them at 11pm_comma_ there is nothing the police will/can do about it unfortunately - but I can imagine how annoying it is.	1 
My best friends invited me to a camping trip but I was a little anxious about the whole thing.	0 
I don't blame  you because I hate camping.	0 
Really? I was just really scared of getting bitten by a tick. I ended up enjoying the trip in the end!	0 
Oh I hate ticks and all the bugs.	1 
i was blown away by how great my friends were this weekend	0 
What happened?	0 
they were very supportive and kind _comma_ helping me with some moving things	0 
You are lucky to have such great friends!	1 
A few weeks ago I was drinking with some friends at a park and I sliced my hand open while trying to rip a beer can in two.	0 
oh that sucks_comma_ i hope it has healed since then	0 
It has! The cut was so deep and I was bleeding so much I was scared of passing out from blood loss.	0 
ouch_comma_ that sounds awful	0 
Moral of the story: don't rip open cans with your hands!	1 
i was shocked how nice the weather was this morning	0 
How come? Have you had awful weather lately?	0 
not really but it was just especially nice this morning	0 
Oh I see. Beautiful weather is an excellent start to the day!	1 
I decided to move to be with my boyfriend.	0 
Oh? Big decision. I hope you feel good about it!	0 
I did_comma_ but I had to leave all my family behind	0 
Aw_comma_ but they'll always be there for you when you visit. You have to do what you want to in life_comma_ after all	1 
im mad at my neighbor today	0 
Oh that sucks! What did your neighbor do to get you angry?	0 
he was using powertools loud in the morning	0 
How inconsiderate. People should have more common sense than your neighbor.	1 
Last Christmas_comma_ I saved up a lot of money and was able to buy my family and girlfriend really nice gifts.	0 
thats awesome_comma_ i always loved giving gifts more than receiving them	0 
Me too! The act of giving makes me feel so warm and happy.	0 
me too!	1 
The teacher I had for Calculus 2 last semester was so terrible at his job_comma_ I had to learn it all on my own.	0 
I hate when I get teachers that are clueless. Makes you wonder how they got the job.	0 
Same here. Surprisingly_comma_ I was able to pass the course and I felt so good about myself!	0 
Well done. You should feel proud for teaching yourself.	1 
i felt happy this morning because it was sunny and warm	0 
That's always a great start to a day.	0 
absolutely_comma_ i was overjoyed	0 
How are you celebrating it?	1 
I have a big exam coming up tomorrow.	0 
Oh wow. What's the exam on?	0 
It's on PC Architecture. I'm feeling pretty good about it though. I studied really hard all week.	0 
That's really great. I am sure you will do well on the test.	1 
On my way back from a funeral_comma_ my friends and I almost got into a deadly car crash.	0 
Oh no_comma_ what happened?	0 
I think the other driver was falling asleep on the road. Out of nowhere_comma_ he moved onto the wrong lane directly towards us.	0 
Well that is really lucky you were able to avoid that. Hopefully he didn't hurt anyone else.	0 
Agreed. I was so scared we could have been the ones in a casket that night.	1 
I was so happy that after many years in retail I found a better job.	0 
Congratulations! Retail really does suck.	0 
Yeah it does. It really made me dislike people a lot.	0 
Understandably. My girlfriend is a student and works in retail part-time. She says the same thing.	1 
Do you ever hear an album and it brings you back to when you first listened to it?	0 
Oh_comma_ all the time. What album is that for you?	0 
I just listened to a Billy Talent album again the other day and it brought me back to high school and reminded me of the person who showed me them.	0 
I really love that album! We will have to listen to it together sometime.	1 
A while back_comma_ my older sister stole my younger brother's iPod touch to sell.	0 
That sucks. Did she make a lot of money off of it?	0 
No idea. All I know is that I was furious_comma_ especially seeing as my brother is the sweetest most innocent kid ever.	0 
I would've been very angry too. I hope the money went towards something useful.	1 
Last night was quite a bummer.	0 
I am sorry to hear that. Why was it a bummer?	0 
I was planning on going to a concert but ended up not going at the last minute because I didn't want to go by myself. I feel like I'm going to regret not going.	0 
That really stinks. I bet you felt really lonely and filled my regret.	1 
After working for a week straight and running a lot of errands_comma_ today is my first day off in a while.	0 
That must feel very refreshing. Would you say you feel content?	0 
It is_comma_ I'm super happy. Currently playing some Zelda on the Switch_comma_ it couldn't get any better than this!	0 
Nice! I want to get that game next week. Looks really cool.	0 
I highly recommend it. I can't put it down.	1 
My older brother always makes promises he can't keep.	0 
That is disappointing. I wonder why he's like that.	0 
I don't know why. Recently we were supposed to go out for sushi lunch together_comma_ but he keeps postponing it. I'll ask him for a definitive day.	0 
I hope he doesn't let you down.	1 
I'm so happy for my brother!	0 
Something good happen to him recently?	0 
He just graduated from college. He put in so much work.	0 
That's amazing! Tell him congratulations from a friendly stranger.	1 
My little brother failed his French class and had to spend three weeks in summer school.	0 
Oh no_comma_ that's not good! He's not the only one that's not great at French. Most of my family spoke French as a second language when I was growing up and I still never picked it up!	0 
French is a really hard language_comma_ I have trouble too so it really hurt my heart seeing him go to school while all his friends and siblings were having fun without him.	0 
Hopefully he'll get to enjoy his next summer.	1 
My boyfriend's brothers got into a fist fight one night and he jumped in the middle.	0 
That sucks. Did anyone get hurt?	0 
Some things got broke and there were some bruises_comma_ but it was really scary to watch that.	0 
I bet. I would've hid under the table.	1 
i am blessed to have a great family	0 
That's nice. Why do you say that?	0 
they're just the best and always very helpful	0 
That's great to hear. I wish I had a helpful family.	1 
Whenever my sister in law plans things_comma_ she only does it around her schedule.	0 
That's really selfish. Have you talked to her about it?	0 
Yeah_comma_ but she says she tries her best and thinks she is doing what is best for everyone. However_comma_ we are the only ones with kids on a schedule.	0 
Well_comma_ at least that's the case. People can only do so much.	1 
This weekend was kind of a drag.	0 
Oh yeah? Why is that?	0 
I couldn't find anyone that wanted to hangout so I had to spend the whole weekend by myself.	0 
Well sometimes that isn't a bad thing really. You didn't enjoy it at all?	0 
I was feeling quite social_comma_ though_comma_ so it was kind of a buzzkill.	1 
The vacations I used to take when I was younger with my family have been on mind lately.	0 
Are the good memories at least?	0 
Oh yeah_comma_ but it really makes me miss those times.	0 
At least you have those memories. You should go on a vacation soon!	1 
I'm looking forward to this new game.	0 
Which one?	0 
The new Spyro Remastered. It really makes feel think back to when I used to play the original with an old friend of mine. 	0 
I've actually haven't played that series. When does it come out?	0 
It comes out next month!	1 
I told my sister in law that I would help her with her books. After this last one_comma_ I felt bad because I told her I couldn't anymore.	0 
That's rough. Why can't you help her?	0 
I just have too much going on now with two kids_comma_ and working from home.	0 
Yeah_comma_ I am in the same boat. It's a hard knock life out there.	1 
I saw some person eat like 30 hamburgers in Mcdonalds	0 
How long did it take them?	0 
I think he was making a Youtube video so he was eating very fast_comma_ so like 10 minutes	0 
He must of been sick after.	1 
One time I bought emergency supplies before a hurricane	0 
That was probably a good plan to buy them ahead of time	0 
Yup_comma_ people started charging like $5 per bottle of water	0 
Wow_comma_ thats insane.  I feel like thats illegal	1 
I just got some frustrating news the other day.	0 
What was the news?	0 
My son got caught cheating on a test. I really thought we raised him better than to do such things but here we are.	0 
Are you going to ground him?	0 
Definitely at least going to have a long talk about why what he did was wrong. There will be some kind of punishment that's for sure.	1 
My sister in law and her fiance are always taking trips abroad and we hardly ever go anywhere.	0 
Why don't you join them?	0 
We definitely don't have money for that_comma_ plus there are four of us.	0 
Why don't you get another job?	1 
Ugh. I got some awful news the other day.	0 
That's too bad. What happened? Is everyone OK?	0 
I got news that my grandfather passed away. He was old but no one saw it coming. 	0 
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I hoep your family is strong enough to support you through this.	1 
Hi there was a time that I was scared out of my mind I came home and my front door was unlocked and the lights were on in the house	0 
Holy cow.  Was anything missing?	0 
no and that was the weird thing nothing was taken	0 
Had they gone through anything?	1 
We recently celebrated my son's birthday_comma_ and had a big party.	0 
oh yeah that must have been a good time	0 
It was! He got a lot of cool toys_comma_ and ate a bunch of ice cream.	0 
Those are the best times when they still like to play with toy's mine lost interest years ago and I miss it	0 
As he opened gifts_comma_ he told people thank you_comma_ and told them thanks for coming when they left.  I was pretty proud of our 4 year-old.	1 
Next month my wife and I will take our first vacation since we got married.	0 
that is awesome i will never forget the first time me and my wife went on vacation_comma_ where do you have planned to go?	0 
We are going to Hawaii for a whole week. We have saved a long time to be able to afford this_comma_ I can barely wait till next month.	0 
That sounds like you guys will spend a lovely time over there good luck	1 
Do you feel when you see your mom after a long time	0 
I miss her. You haven't seen your mom in a long time?	0 
Why! what is the reason	0 
I'm sorry_comma_ but I can't understand what you're saying.	0 
Are you were near to your mom	1 
Last year_comma_ during the spring_comma_ extremely heavy rainfall caused our basement to become flooded.	0 
Oh man! I have been there_comma_ I hope you didn't have anything special down there??	0 
I lost all of my childhood photos and many of my childhood toys and things I had saved_comma_ my bible from my late grandmother being one of the items.	0 
Oh lord_comma_ i am so sorry! I have been there_comma_ that is hard!	1 
Last week_comma_ my coworkers all got together and threw me at party for my 20th anniversary at work.	0

I took my dog to the vet yesterday... it turns out that he's really sick.	0 
Aww_comma_ I'm sorry.  Is he going to be ok?	0 
It's not looking too good. I really hope he pulls through.	0 
I do too.  That's one of the saddest things.  I hope you'll be OK too.	1 
I was working on a project in this past week_comma_ couldn't find it locally_comma_ so ended up ordering it online.	0 
wow nice	0 
Not really_comma_ it still hasn't shown up!  I'm pretty annoyed!	0 
ooops sorry to hear that	0 
It's not that big of a deal_comma_ but I was really looking forward to finishing the project.	1 
I saw a deer get hit by a car yesterday.	0 
oh that sucks.. did someone move it out of the way?	0 
It wasn't dead_comma_ It was injured and moved to the brush on the side of the road. it was upsetting.	0 
yea you never like to see stuff like that.	1 
I opened up my mailbox this morning and there was a 10 dollar bill just sitting there inside!	0 
did you try to find its owner?	0 
I asked my neighbors about it_comma_ no one knew anything about it. I guess it was left there intentionally.	0 
well that was nice of someone	1 
A co-worker I've been working on a project with has been late	0 
That's annoying_comma_ are you going to talk to them about it?	0 
I plan on doing that_comma_ it's pretty disruptive	0 
I hope it all works out in the end.	1 
I just finished a major project at work for a client	0 
Awesome! Can you say what kind of project it is?	0 
Not at the moment_comma_ but I'm praying my supervisor and client likes it	0 
I hope so too! Projects can be stressful!	1 
I have an appointment for tomorrow. I'm hoping the same thing.	0 
What is the appointment for?	0 
My cat hasn't been feeling well this past week_comma_ I think there might be something really wrong.	0 
Let's hope not! My prayers are with her.	0 
I know. I'm so worried.	1 
Thank you. I hope it's something that he will get over soon.	0 
You're welcome. It's always nerve wrecking when family is sick like that.	0 
5	0 
I think there might be something wrong with the platform at the moment.	1 
My child needs to start going to bed early to prep for school. Last night_comma_ I caught her sneaking her phone and watching tv at 12am.	0 
Oh man_comma_ sounds like most kids. She's gonna hate it at first_comma_ but getting to bed early will help with her future.	0 
I've tried to explain that to her. It's like it goes in one ear and out the other. It bugs me.	0 
Well yea_comma_ they're young right now and can't see the consequences yet.	1 
A group of coworkers who play the same lottery numbers every week won $100_comma_000 on the pick 6 last week.	0 
that is so lucky_comma_ they must be so happy they bought that ticket	0 
They had asked me if I wanted to go in with them_comma_ and I said no. I regret that now_comma_ I could have really used a share of that money.	0 
i know that is such a bomber you must have been so angry hahaha	1 
I studied really had so I am sure I will pass my test!	0 
What kind of test is it	0 
It was my science final for college. 	0 
Oh I hope you do well then	1 
My friend went on a 14 day cruise to Europe. I wish that could have been me! 	0 
wow i didnt even know they had cruises that go on for that long	0 
Right? Talk about ultimate relaxation!	0 
yea i wonder how much something like that costs .. i guess if you have to ask you cant afford it as they say	1 
My son is supposed to be sending me some money...	0 
that is really nice of him_comma_ how much time will you have to wait?	0 
Hopefully not too much longer. I've been waiting for a few days now.	0 
well i hope everything goes well at the bank and with the transaction	1 
I am scared of another hurricane coming through Florida. I had a bad experience last year.	0 
that is horrible_comma_ natural disaster are the worst because you cant do anything against them	0 
No_comma_ all you can do is try to prepare. Do you live anywhere where there is threat of natural disasters? 	0 
not really_comma_ the worst thing that can happen where i live is a thunderstorm	1 
When my son was born it felt like I had everything I needed in life.	0 
I bet that was a wonderful day	0 
It really was_comma_ my life finally felt complete.	0 
I am very happy for you	1 
I got passed over for a promotion at work last week_comma_ even thought I had more experience than the other applicants.	0 
that is not good_comma_ have you expressed your feelings to your boss?	0 
I did_comma_ and it looks like I may be looking for a new job soon as they want to take the company in a new direction.	0 
well i hope everything goes well for you_comma_ you will sure find something fitting for you dont worry	1 
I remember when I started my first office job out of college. I was nervous because I didn't know what to expect.	0 
It's a whole new world when that happens_comma_ I can totally understand. How'd you cope with it?	0 
I just tried to keep an open mind and go with the flow. It was hard to get used to sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day_comma_ but I soon got used to it.	0 
It's always best to just open your mind to anything that could happen. It's the best way to learn.	0 
I agree. And if it doesn't work out_comma_ you can always move on to something different.	1 
I found some mold growing out in the garage	0 
Oh no_comma_ that's bad.   Have you had someone come out and check the hose?	0 
I ended up cleaning it myself_comma_ I think I got most of it out	0 
May be worth letting your insruance comapny know. Usually they have clauses that you have to tell them as soon as you see it otherwise they won't cover any of it.	1 
I was thinking about when we finally got to go pick up Rodimus after all that waiting!  I've never been so excited in my life.  	0 
what is that?	0 
It's our Rotty pup! Sorry haha	0 
oh that explains it!	0 
Yes!  We had been waiting forever to find just the right breeder and then we found him oh my gosh.  That felt like the longest week of my life!	1 
I saw a child ask for a candy bar that the grocery store yesterday. The mother spanked the child in front over every one in the line!	0 
Wow when the child just asked?!	0 
Yes! It was awful! Luckily the man behind her spoke up. I could tell she was embarrassed but I was furious at her!	0 
I'm only afraid that the mom is going to let out that embarassment on her child once they get home.	0 
I agree. I hate seeing kids having to live in that type of situation. some people shouldn't be parents	1 
One time I saw someone's dog pooping in my lawn and they didn't pick it up!	0 
OMG that's so gross! 	0 
Yes_comma_ I wanted to throw it back at them!	0 
That would be a memorable lesson to learn. The best lessons are learned that hard way_comma_ after all. 	1 
I used the bathroom at Walmart the other day. I walked around the store for about 30 minutes before I realized I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe!!!	0 
Oh god. That's kinda gross.	0 
I felt gross hahaha I kicked it off of my shoe and stuffed it under a rack. I hope know one saw.	0 
Rest in peace whoever touches that rack.	0 
hahaha hope they wear gloves!	1 
My son just started a new school.  The communication with them has been terrible!	0 
Oh dear. How do they let the parents know what's going on?	0 
I sometimes find out but it seems so disorganized!	0 
That sounds really frustrating. I'm sorry that's happening!	1 
We went to the lagoon a few weeks ago. My friends dared me to jump off of the highest cliff into the water.	0 
Oh wow.  Terrifying.  All I think of is Johnny Erricson Tada_comma_ who broke her neck in that situation. Did you do it?	0 
That was what I was worried about! I ended up not jumping off of the highest one. I was too scared. I did jump off of the smallest one. That was really fun!	0 
You did the right thing!  Oh fun!  I'm glad you were safe and had a blast! 	1 
I have a test coming up in one of my classes this week.	0 
Do you feel ready for it?	0 
Oh yeah_comma_ I'm definitely ready. I know I'm going to pass.	0 
Awesome_comma_ hope it goes as planned!	1 
I had about 6 or 7 hummingbirds in my yard the other day feeding.	0 
Oh how exciting! Did you take any pictures?	0 
No. my camera isn't good enough to get good pictures_comma_ they are so small.	0 
Awww...that's a bit disappointing_comma_ but really cool that you got to see them!	1 
I was trying to buy a piece of property that came up on the market_comma_ but someone put in a bid before I got a chance and it has already sold.	0 
The market can be competitive if the price is right. They'll sell immediatley.	0 
It is a piece of property that my grandfather owned and I pretty much grew up on_comma_ I would have really liked to have owned it.	0 
That would have been awesome if you got it.	1 
I worked for weeks on a presentation for work. I practiced over and over. I felt relaxed the morning of.	0 
That's good! That probably means you worked on it until it became something you're proud of.	0 
You are right! I was really proud of it! I'm glad I worked so hard on it. It lessened the anxiety that I usually have!	0 
Maybe I could learn from that. I get really nervous when I have to do any public speaking_comma_ so maybe if I just prepared for it better it would help.	1 
I was under the impression that my friends would pay me back.	0 
What did they do to you?	0 
They owed me money but never paid me back. I suppose it's not a huge deal though.	0 
It happens sometimes. you may ask them directly to pay back.	1 
I worked with daughter for months with learning her multiplication tables. We've practiced and practiced and she still doesn't know them all!	0 
I totally get that.  I'm in the same place with my daughter.  I home school and she's learning them too. Give it time and she'll get it soon.  Its so much to memorize at once! 	0 
We homeschool too! I hope she can get them soon! It will make this year's math so much easier!	0 
That's awesome!  She will!  The best thing about homeschooling is that they can learn more at their own pace.  I'm not looking forward to division! ha ha	1 
I'm going on a hiking trip soon	0 
Do you hike very often?	0 
Here and there when I have time	0 
I've never been hiking_comma_ really! I'd like to go some day.	1 
I scrapbook pictures of my son and I am a few years behind!	0 
Oh_comma_ such fun!  Do you have all the Stamp It Up scrapbooking things I hear so much about? I bet it can be hard to keep it updated! They grow so fast!	0 
My son just started school all day_comma_ so I plan to start scrapbooking.  I don't use Stamp It Up though.	0 
Perfect!  Now you'll be caught up in no time.  I know you'll be so gratified to finish and be able to look at all of them when he's much older.	1 
This past weekend_comma_ my cat Sam passed away_comma_ he was 17 years old.	0 
So sorry to hear of Sam's passing.	0 
Yeah_comma_it's been really strange the past few days without him asleep on my feet while I work.	0 
May your many memories of Sam help you to sustain at this difficult time.	1 
I have nothing to complain about. Life is good.	0 
That is awesome.  I'm with you on that.  Tough times might pop up now and then but life really is great.  I don't like to take it for granted.	0 
No point in being a pessimist.	0 
Exactly! You'll go far with that attitude!  	1 
I baked a cake for my boyfriend's birthday and it turned out to be so delicious! He was so excited. 	0 
Mmm_comma_ now you're making me hungry for cake. What kind of cake was it?	0 
Black forest cake! It happens to be both our favorite kind of cake. I made it from scratch. What's your favorite cake? 	0 
Personally I'm a huge fan of red velvet_comma_ but black forest is amazing too!	1 
I felt so bad when I had to board my dog while I was on vacation. It made me feel like a bad dog mom! 	0 
Aww_comma_ I know that can be hard_comma_ but you can't be too hard on yourself.  Sometimes you don't have a choice.	0 
I know. She was so excited when we came home though which made us feel a bit better. 	0 
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.	1 
I'm happy with the person that I grew up to be.	0 
What are some of your best traits?	0 
I'm healthy!	0 
Do you exercise often?	1 
So we finally found the perfect Rotty breeder and we got to pick up our puppy this week!	0 
Oh boy that is great news! I hope you didn't drop a pretty penny on it! Haha_comma_ and even if you did_comma_ dogs are worth it.	0 
No he was the runt so we got him on the cheap side!  He is sooooo sweet!  I am so happy	0 
Hey runts are the best! They need love too. Either way_comma_ I'm glad you were paired up with the perfect companion.	0 
Thank you!  We are so excited!	1 
I love going to Disney World. It makes me remember all the wonderful memories I made there as a child.	0 
I've never been_comma_ but it looks like so much fun.	0 
It is a great place for both kids and adults! I don't have any kids yet_comma_ but can't wait to bring mine when I have them someday. 	0 
It would be so much fun to go there as a family.	1 
Sometimes when I am out in public_comma_ my son throws a tantrum.	0 
Oh yeah I am right there with you_comma_ I just don't even go out anymore if I can help it! How old is yours? Mines 2 1/2	0 
Mine is 5.  Every now and then_comma_ he says a curse word_comma_ uses it properly too!	0 
They are too smart for their own good	1 
I was just about to make a sandwich to eat_comma_ when I discovered something really gross.	0 
what did you see? please don't tell me there was a bug in your bread	0 
No_comma_ there weren't any bugs. But there was mold.	0 
ewwww_comma_ so nasty! i almost ate a molded avocado today. good thing i noticed before scooping it	1 
The head of marketing at my job recently dumped a bunch of new tasks on me and my coworker. I feel like she's just lazy and making us do her job.	0 
or maybe she just knows you're a great worker and very responsible? I hope you will get a raise after completing those tasks	0 
Ha_comma_ that's a really nice way of looking at it but nah I'm pretty sure it's mostly laziness.	0 
did you try talking to her about it? Just be straight forward and tell you how you feel	0 
I thought about it but no_comma_ it's not worth rocking the boat. If she tries to pull that again and dump even more on us_comma_ then I'll probably say something.	1 
I can't believe this!  Some kid at the gas station nearly hit me and then had the nerve to call me awful names!	0 
Did you call the police?	0 
No!  I got so flustered and kind of paniked.  	0 
Its horrible to have to got through things like thaty	1 
Guess what!  I nailed my review for this year and got a raise!	0 
That's great! I'm so happy for you!	0 
Thank you! I worked so hard and I am so freaking excited!  I am also up for a promotion if we keep growing!	0 
Ooh_comma_ will you be managing anyone?	1 
I freaking dropped my coffee on the ground this morning	0 
I hear you! I drop things all the time. Was it one you just bought?	0 
Yes.  And to make it even worse I soaked myself!	0 
Ugh! Were you away from home?	0 
Right outside the office and with no spare clothes!	1 
My stepdaughter graduated from college in May and got a job in San Francisco making 3 times more than I have ever made.	0 
Oh wow_comma_ she's doing great. I know it probably feels a bit bad that she's making so much more than you_comma_ but hopefully you can find  away to be proud of her.	0 
I'm definitely proud! It doesn't feel bad at all. I'm so happy about how much drive she has to succeed.	0 
Oh well that's great! Some people would get a little jealous. I'm glad you're proud of her_comma_ I'm sure she worked very hard for her success!	0 
I'm maybe a little jealous_comma_ but I know how hard she works and how smart she has been with her decisions.	1 
Whew. I finally got all of my work done for the day.	0 
That is a good feeling!	0 
It really is! Now I can go home and just relax for the rest of the evening.	0 
Nice! No kids at home?	0 
Nope_comma_ just me. So it's nice and quiet.	1 
I am so nervous.  I have to go to the dentist tomorrow to get a filling replaced. 	0 
Are you afraid of the dentist?	0 
I am!  I had a bad experience with one when I was younger.	0 
I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ I'm pretty terrified of the dentist myself. Ask for gas! Good luck_comma_ I'm sure everything will be just fine.	1 
I spoke at a conference recently. I was a little scared going into it but felt great as I knew I knew my speech.	0 
Oh nice! That's super brave of you.	0 
I'm actually one of those fortunate people who doesn't have a fear of public speaking. 	0 
That's a great skill to have!	1 
I was cleaning out my attic and found a box full of old photo albums. I spent the next few hours looking at old photos and having a great time.	0 
That must have been a nice feeling. 	0 
It really was. I miss a lot of the people in the photos_comma_ made me really smile to see their faces again.	0 
I love that nostalgic feeling. 	1 
I am so irritated.  My dog keeps trying to eat up my shoes no matter where I put them!	0 
Haha_comma_ sounds like my pupper_comma_ is she still young?	0 
Yeah she's only about six months.  Despite all her chew toys its still my shoes she craves...	0 
Right!? It's weird_comma_ you buy them all the toys in the world_comma_ but they still go after your stuff.	1 
My husband works late at night and sometimes I'm stuck by myself.	0 
Why he is working late?	0 
He owns his own business working on cars. If something goes wrong_comma_ he is forced to stay to fix the issue.	0 
I understand. Could you plan to do something when he is late (going out with friends)?	0 
That's a good idea! Maybe I can have a boardgame night or something!	1 
My aunt just signed for my cousin to get an FJ Cruiser! That is my dream car! He doesn't even have a job.	0 
Aww man that sucks for you 	0 
It does! Maybe he will at least let me drive it!	0 
Hopefully! It is your dream car after all	1 
I'm looking forward to visiting a friend over the weekend	0 
That should be fun. Any big planes?	0 
Nothing too big_comma_ probably just wander around town	0 
That will be nice to catch up.	1 
I'm so irritated at my neighbor. She moved out recently and left ALL her garbage and old furniture in our parking lot by the garbage.	0 
That's not very considerate of her. Was she a bad neighbor while she lived there too? Some people!	0 
Not at all_comma_ that's what is so weird! She was really polite_comma_ quiet_comma_ and neat.	0 
I wonder what could have changed? Either way_comma_ I'd be pretty pissed off.	0 
I am! But whatever_comma_ nothing we can do but have the city come pick it up I guess.	1 
Last week the plant I work at was hit with massive layoffs. 	0 
Oh no! That is terrible!	0 
I was fortunate enough to be one of the very few who got to keep their job_comma_ I am happy but very sad for the others.	0 
I understand. Layoffs are hard. My brother in law has been through a lot of those at factories!	1 
Two years ago my wife and I got divorced. It has been very odd in this big house all by myself.	0 
How do you feel these days?	0 
It has gotten a little better with time_comma_ but still a pretty sore spot for me.	0 
It must be difficult_comma_ do you think she will come back ever?	1 
I lost my job earlier this year. I was really worried about how to pay my bills and finding a new job.	0 
Ouch! That's rather painful. What are you doing now?	0 
Well that's the cool thing... the week my unemployment ran out I got a job offer. At my former company_comma_ no less. So everything worked out!	0 
Wow! That's like a paid vacation!	0 
Haha that's an awesome way to think about it!	1 
Last week a friend of mine won $2000 on a scratch off ticket. I buy those things all the time and never win squat.	0 
Wow_comma_ that's incredible. What's their secret? 	0 
Right place_comma_ right time I guess. Some people are just lucky.	0 
Congrats to your friend. I hope they share!	1 
My niece got sent home from school yesterday with that stomach bug that's going around	0 
That's unfortunate_comma_ hope you don't get it as well!	0 
I know!  I've been pretty worried about her.  She's such a tiny thing.	0 
I'm sure she will be fine with some rest and a little bit of time. 	1 
My phone went missing. Imagine my surprise when I got a Facebook message "from myself_comma_" it was the person who found it saying "I have your phone."	0 
Wow... that's kind of creepy actually. Were you able to get it back?	0 
I was! The guy was really nice and refused the cash I tried to give him as a reward.	0 
You're very lucky he was nice and didn't steal any of your data.	0 
Very! Lucky for me it was a cheap phone_comma_ I think if I had the newest iPhone or something I would have never seen it again.	1 
I just got some new neighbors. I'm kinda nosy so I asked if I could take a look at how they decorated_comma_ just out of curiosity.	0 
Did you bring them a pan of ludefisk first? What did they say?	0 
Nah_comma_ although I did consider brownies. They were happy to meet me so it was all good. But man I couldn't believe how nice their place looked compared to mine! I am a little jealous of their interior decorating skills.	0 
Next time they let you in_comma_ just steal all your favorite pieces of decor and replace them with brownies.	1 
My kid was signing The Spice Girls a few years ago. She thought she had discovered a new band! She asked if I had ever heard of them before.	0 
Yeah_comma_ they are cute like that. How old is she ?	0 
She almost 11 now. She loves to listen to all of the bands from when I was younger. It's really cute.	0 
I have a 10 year old like that.	1 
My daughter practiced her gymnastics every day all summer. We just found out that she made the team!	0 
that's amazing. watching your children succeed is so rewarding	0 
It is! I cannot wait to see what's in store for her future! Maybe a scholarship!	0 
that is awesome. i hope she has very much success in her gymnastic endevours.	0 
thank you!	0 
you are very welcome. good luck!	1 
My grandma threw away my high school yearbooks.	0 
That's awful! I hope that she didn't mean too!	0 
I don't think she realized what they were. I was pretty irritated as they can't be replaced but what can you do?	0 
Yeah_comma_ It really sounds like she didn't mean to. Sometimes you can find copies online if you look. 	0 
Good suggestion! Really I wanted to keep all the signatures and notes from my friends but oh well. I will see them next month for our reunion anyway!	1 
We've had our dog for over 8 years. He past away this spring.	0 
I'm so so sorry!  We lost our chihuahua in February_comma_ so I completely understand that feeling.  Was he sick prior to passing away or was it sudden?	0 
It was sudden. He was completely fine when we went to bed. No issues at all. Its been hard for our daughter	0 
I think it might actually be harder to watch our kids go through that kind of loss than to actually go through it ourselves.  Our pup was our daughter's dog and she was sick prior to passing_comma_ so we knew it was coming.  Still doesn't really help though.  We ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom - it was meant to me - my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom.  It's helped_comma_ something to think about at least.	0 
I completely agree. I broke down just watching her cry at the spot where we buried him. I'm not sure if I want to get another dog yet. We have chickens so she's began to show them more attention now.	1 
I bought my daughter her first cell phone. It's a lot of responsibility for her. I hope she is ready for it.	0 
I am sure she will be smart with it	0 
I hope so. She has done well with tablets so I'm hoping she'll do the same with a phone	0 
You can always show her the ways	0 
This is true! I also put an app on her phone to block things she's not old enough to use	1 
I accidentally knocked over a little kid coming out of the store the other day.	0 
Were they okay?	0 
Yeah thankfully he was totally fine. But I felt so bad.	0 
At least you're not getting sued	0 
Oh man_comma_ that would be terrible. Way to look on the bright side!	0 
Im good at that lol	1 
I'm going skydiving this weekend. My stomach all ready hurts with fear.	0 
Don't worry you'll be fine.  It's safe.	0 
This is my 3rd time and I'm still scared	0 
I'm surprised you haven't started to relax a little yet.	0 
Have you ever went. When you looking down from 15_comma_000 feet you get scared.	1 
We moved into a 200 year old house. There are creeks and cracks that creep me out!	0 
I can only imagine. At least its nice in the day time though?	0 
Sometimes. I try to avoid that attic during any time of the day! There's also a weird door about knee-height. When you open it up_comma_ it's just big enough to fit a storage tub.	0 
I am not sure I would do well in that house	0 
It is really creepy! 	1 
After my mom passed away I found all our old cassette tapes in her storage_comma_ listening to those was pretty cool.	0 
Bet that brought back good memories.	0 
Definitely_comma_ brought me right back to the road trips we took when I was younger.	0 
Where did you guys usually go?	0 
Everywhere! Sometimes we just hopped in the car and went like two or three hours from home just to do something for the day.	1 
I've spent all day getting my kit ready for the next competition this weekend. I'm exhausted.	0 
whats the competition on ?	0 
Highland games. I throw the caber and heavy hammer.	0 
Nice hope you win _comma_ ill be looking into this further 	1 
I'm so angry at my self. I was in my performance review today and I passed wind in front of my boss. OMG 	0 
I wonder how that was noted on your report.	0 
I got a raise so not that bad but it was still off putting. I've heard her rip one in the past so I guess no judgement. 	0 
Sounds like a wacky place to work.	1 
I got a raise today. I've pushed my self hard this last year and I deserve it.	0 
That is awesome. Congratulations. Im sure you earned every penny.	0 
Thanks it's been a rough year. My hours were cut but I was expected to keep up the same work load. Thanks again!	0 
Good things happen to people who put in the effort. It sounds well deserved.	1 
For the last few nights I've heard weird sounds outside my bedroom window.	0 
Oh no! Do you think it's a wild animal?	0 
I don't think so_comma_ it doesn't sound like any animal I recognize. It's really creepy.	0 
I hope it's not a crazy person or worse_comma_ an alien waiting to abduct you!	1 
I told my daughter she wasn't allowed to watch Youtube because it's hard to monitor. I caught her sneaking and watching videos last night!	0 
Its so hard to monitor that stuff now	0 
It is! There's also a ton of weird stuff on there that's labeled for kids.	0 
Yeah_comma_ that is a scary thing to think about too	1 
I walk my dog for 30 minutes at a time but no matter what_comma_ he always ends up using the bathroom inside! I wish he would left me know if he needs to go out.	0 
On no!  That is no good!  Is he still a puppy?	0 
No! He's about 2 years old now. Sometimes I think he does it out a spite when he's not getting enough attention!	0 
Hopefully he is not doing it out of spite!  Maybe you should hire a dog trainer to see if they can correct his behavior.	0 
That's not a bad idea!	1 
My neighbor stole a package from me.	0 
No way? Do you have proof? That is terrible.	0 
So check this out_comma_ I ordered a planter for my porch. That's how I know he did it_comma_ the exact planter I ordered and never got appeared on HIS porch a few days after my package went missing!	0 
Wow. That is horrible. I would get a camera and try to film them in the act and go to the police. I would be so angry.	0 
Yeah_comma_ I'm pretty livid. I think I will report him to our HOA and see what they say.	1 
I moved to northern Alaska last year and don't know anyone. 	0 
you havent met all three people in the city yet?	0 
haha. I live about 1 hour south of Barrow the most northern place in the USA and about 12 hours north of any actual city. 	0 
ah well it sounds like i hit the nail on the head	0 
It's the most beautiful place you can move just no one here. Me and the animals. 	1 
My coworker was able to find a new job after only looking for like a week.	0 
What kind of job was it	0 
Sales_comma_ so I'm not really envious about that part as I'm not into sales but I was still upset that he found a job so easily and I couldn't. We both wanted out of that company so bad.	0 
Sales do sound hard to do	1 
My cat got sick the other day_comma_ he was really pathetic. I felt so bad for him.	0 
Is he going to be okay	0 
Yes_comma_ thankfully! The vet gave him some fluids and I made sure he got some food in him. He's doing much better today.	0 
I am glad then_comma_ I hate to see pets in pain	1 
My friend is a single mom who works full time. She just graduated college!	0 
That is quite an accomplishment.  Someone like that is really inspiring.	0 
Right? I'm so proud of her. Her accomplishment really made me think about just how lazy I am in my own life haha	0 
Hahahaha_comma_ it's hard to compare yourself with that_comma_ but it really let's you know what's possible if you really want something.	1 
I think I got my coworker in trouble.	0 
Why? Were they not working?	0 
He called in sick_comma_ but spent the day at the waterpark with his kids. I didn't realize he'd called in sick_comma_ I thought he was just out. So_comma_ I accidentally told my boss where he was.	0 
He should have been honest from the start. It's on him not you.	0 
Thanks_comma_ that's a good point. Or at least let me know he's going to lie so I can cover for him!	0 
Do you think your boss will tell him it's you that told on him?	1 
Saturday I'm climbing Mt. Elbert the highest Mountain in the lower 48. The nerves has started to set in.	0 
That's so cool! Do you do a lot of climbing?	0 
Not so much any more that I moved to the east coast. I do more surfing now but I was able to get off work so I fly into Colorado Thursday.	0 
Wow_comma_ so a proper adventure then. Have fun and stay safe!	1 
Drove past the area my Middle school was in today. It was gone. I hated it when I was in school but now that's it gone I'm sad	0 
yea funny how that happens	0 
It was not even that long ago I went to that school. It's been less then 10 years. They did not even build anything. It's a park now.	0 
well at least its being put to good use	1 
I'm going to job interview Thursday. I'm currently employed but I'm ready to move on.	0 
Hey congrats!  Is it in the same field?	0 
Yes_comma_ I'm currently in middle management this would be the next step up. I'm excited and nervous 	0 
Heyyy! That's awesome!  I wish you luck! Will it come with a sweet raise too?	1 
My cousin passed the CPA exam!	0 
Congratulation. What is he planning to do next?	0 
She's already working at a Big 4 firm so she's just going to stick with that for a few years. I'm proud of her_comma_ it wasn't easy!	0 
Good. I hope it will help her in career growth.	1 
I just got a new manager at work. She is really young but seems to be full of good ideals.	0 
That's cool!  Maybe you'll get along great!	0 
I plan to steer clear. I'm going to relocate in January so I just need to lay low. I hope she does a great job.	0 
lol why do you have to steer clear?	0 
I'm not looking to make a good or bad impression. I just want to do my job and go home. 	0 
ahhh.  I got you!  Well good luck on the relocation!	1 
The other weekend I really wanted to go out_comma_ but I realized I don't have any good friends left.	0 
That is a bad realization to come to.  Where did they all go?	0 
Well I used to hang out with a lot of my coworkers but I left that job. And just kind of drifted away from everyone else. I definitely need to find a new sport or something and make new friends.	0 
Yeah_comma_ that is tough.  Once you get to a certain age you have to work pretty hard to meet people.  Maybe you could join a softball league_comma_ that's what I did.	1 
The other day I was short on cash I needed to pay my phone bill. 	0 
It can be hard these days_comma_ money is tight	0 
So true. I lucked out though and found a $20 bill on the ground! I hope the person who lost it didn't need it really bad because it definitely helped me out.	0 
I bet that was a nice surprise	1 
I lost my credit card this weekend and then in the worst place Walmart.	0 
Did you get it all straightened out?	0 
Yes I was very stun someone did a good deed and turned it in with my wallet and all the money in it I was very grateful. 	0 
Wow that is awesome_comma_ too rare in these times_comma_ count your lucky stars!	1 
My oldest daughter started elementary school today I was so glad she had a great first day.	0 
Oh wonderful!  I'm glad it went so well!  Did she already know some friends there or was it a new school for her?	0 
A new school that's why I was kind of nervous and scared but she loved it.	0 
Oh boy_comma_ I bet you were nervous.  I would've been too!  Sounds like she's got a great and fun year ahead of her!	1 
My neighbor keeps letting her dog use the bathroom on her balcony.	0 
That is just gross!  Have you spoken to her about it?	0 
It's revolting. I reported her to the HOA but she keeps doing it. I'm going to say something if I catch her out there letting her dog out.	0 
I hope the HOA does something about that - that's just disgusting!	1 
The other day I made fish tacos and did nothing else all day but relax on the couch.	0 
Bet that was a nice calming down.	0 
Very. It was nice and chill and low pressure_comma_ just how I like it.	0 
Did you get up to anything else fun?	0 
Not doing anything WAS my idea of fun!	1 
I did a walk a thon last week for back to school drive and needy kids it was s long walk but I finished it I felt so happy. 	0 
That sounds awesome_comma_ i bet you feel proud! Its nice to do things for kids who are in need.	0 
I did before the walk I was un-assured I would finish but I did so I was overly proud and it was a great cause that raised lots of money. 	0 
Of course! Dont let fear of not finishing stop you from doing anything!	1 
Went out to eat with my boyfriend the other day. Saw our waiter pick his nose and wipe it on his shirt.	0 
Oh gross_comma_ I would lose my appetite	0 
It really was gross. I was so grossed out I asked to get moved to the bar so we could get a different server.	0 
Yeah_comma_ I would probably just leave the restaurant altogether	1 
I am so scared of snakes there was one in my back yard a few weeks ago.	0 
Oh my goodness_comma_ that is no fun.  Was it poisonous?	0 
When I looked it up on line it was one of the garden snakes but I'm still frightened by them all lol even the harmless ones. 	0 
They can still bite_comma_ so it's better safe than sorry.  My father-in-law just got bitten by a black snake recently-not poisonous-but still painful.	0 
I will stay clear of them all not taking any chances. 	1 
I'm a neat freak and my house has to stay clean and in place always such a pet peeve of mines. 	0 
Do you have OCD?	0 
Very bad and when my family has the house out of place I become so furious I just like things clean and in order.	0 
I just love when the house is clean_comma_ makes you feel good.	0 
Yes and so relaxed and peaceful. 	1 
My supervisor totally stole all the credit for a client I brought in.	0 
That's a bad supervisor. Did you call him/her out on it?	0 
I totally did. And let the CEO know about his behavior.	0 
I hope he got in trouble!	0 
Unfortunately no_comma_ the CEO thinks he can do no wrong. Eventually he'll figure out what a jerk he is.	1 
I start back college next week I can't wait to finish getting my degree for me and my family. 	0 
Oh most are dreading going back to school. What's your major?	0 
I'm going for nursing and I have dreaded going back for 6 years now but my support system pushed me to follow my dream I'm thankful to have them.	0 
Nursing can be difficult_comma_ but if you have determination and a good support system_comma_ I'm sure you'll do great!	0 
It is but I know the hard work will pay off in the end.	1 
I recently applied for a promotion at work.	0 
How'd it go?	0 
I didn't get it.	0 
I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope another opportunity comes up.	0 
Me_comma_ too.  Then I found out someone else less qualified got it.	1 
I'm shopping for a new bicycle! Can't wait to pick one out.	0 
That sounds like fun!  Are you big into biking?	0 
I have been recently_comma_ yes. I'm using an old beat up hand-me-down mountain bike so getting the right bike for me is going to be so much fun.	0 
Mountain biking is great.  Is is really theraputic.  I hope you enjoy your new bike	1 
The crime rate in my city is so high right now it breaks my heart and things need to change.	0 
That's horrible. What can people do to change things?	0 
First thing get the young crowd out the streets and take the weapons away a 7 year old passed this weekend because of this it is so heart breaking.	0 
Yes! The weapons thing is so important. 	1 
Found out recently that one of my best friends from back home died in an accident.	0 
Oh my gosh! That is horrible! I am so sorry to hear that.	0 
Thank you. I don't even have it in me to call her parents and offer my condolences yet_comma_ it's just too shocking.	0 
I understand that. Just give it some time and call when you are ready.	1 
I started my new job last week and already I feel part of the team. 	0 
That's great. Getting good coworkers is so hit or miss sometimes.	0 
It is and that's why I was nervous but the staff was so kind and open. 	0 
That sounds like a wonderful place. I'm kinda jealous hahaha.	0 
Lol don't be let's just hope I can still say this in 3 months. 	1 
One time someone kicked my dog!	0 
That's awful! What did you do?	0 
Nothing! My dog was just walking passed him!	0 
No. I mean did you yell at the person or anything after they did it?	1 
I got laid off from a job that I really used to love.	0 
Woah that's really bad!! Is it due to cost cutting? They let you off.	0 
Sort of_comma_ the company was being run into the ground by poor management. It hurt at first but then I realized just how much I'd started to hate the work and the company.	0 
it happens!! i hope you will find a better job with a better company!!	1 
I can't believe I lost my phone today while running errands.	0 
Oh no_comma_ that's the worst.	0 
Sad part is I have no idea which store that's why I am so upset.	0 
I hope you can get it back somehow!	1 
I ended up on one of those "Top 40 under 40" lists for people in my profession. Felt pretty good.	0 
That is an amazing accomplishment.  What field are you in?	0 
Finance_comma_ basically_comma_ but it was a little broader than that. I wish my mom were still around_comma_ she would have been so happy.	0 
I'm sure you know that she is so proud of you!  That is really incredible!  Congratulations!	0 
Thank you!	1 
I was shocked my husband bought me flowers today out of the blue.	0 
That is so romantic.  They weren't for any occasion?	0 
Nope not at all_comma_ that's why I was so shocked! 	0 
Were they your favorites?	1 
I was so grossed out about the molded bread I bought today.	0 
Oh yuck. Did you get a chance to return it to the store?	0 
I tried to_comma_ but they had a no refund policy. 	0 
That's crazy! I'd leave it on the counter at the store. Hopefully you aren't out much money.	1 
Seeing my kids face when I finally brought a puppy home was priceless! 	0 
Wow that must have been amazing!	0 
It really was_comma_ and I got it on video too.	0 
They're going to remember that forever	1 
While my car was parked on the street in front of my house last week_comma_ someone ran into it and left a huge dent.	0 
Dang_comma_ that sucks. Did you ever catch the culprit?	0 
No_comma_ they didn't leave a insurance card or anything_comma_ just drove off. Some people are so worthless.	0 
Yeah_comma_ that guy sounds like a jerk. Did your insurance cover the dent?	1 
Last month my dog Skippy passed away. He was 18 years old.	0 
Oh wow! My dog Jr died of old age too.	0 
Man it's hard. He has been like my best friend since I was a teenager.	0 
Oh_comma_ Did something happen to him?	1 
My dog died of old age today.	0 
I am sorry to hear that. Mine died of old age as well last month.	0 
I am sorry that happened too. I never thought I would be this upset over a dog.	0 
Me neither_comma_ but in the end_comma_ I really didn't think about him as a dog_comma_ he was just my buddy. I hope fond memories of him get you through this.	1 
I waited the longest three weeks of my life to get something I ordered online.	0 
That can be so aggravating. Did the company make it up to you for being so late?	0 
It got worse. When it finally arrived_comma_ the box was all busted up and my item was broken. So yeah_comma_ safe to say they had a lot to make up for.	0 
At least they made up for it. If they had not I wouldn't use them again.	1 
My husband has been getting on my nerves worrying about his football team losing.	0 
I know the feeling. What team is he rooting for? 	0 
He is crazy about the Falcons.	0 
I don't even know what team that is_comma_ haha. Football is lost on me. 	1 
I am also sure I fixed my computer today.	0 
Oh that's good_comma_ last time my computer broke was a day before I left the country	0 
That would be a nightmare! All I had to do was replace the fan.	0 
I took it to the apple store and it actually got fixed in 5 mins_comma_ just needed a hardware reset	1 
My husband was just sent to Iraq and I already miss him so much.	0 
Oh my goodness_comma_ is he with the armed forces?	0

I am in shock ever since my house caught on fire while I was at work.	0 
That is horrible_comma_ did anyone get hurt?	0

I had my front door open and a cat (not mine) ran in my house.	0 
Not yours? That is so weird_comma_ usually they  are on their way OUT not IN! Lol	0 
I know! we were all surprised. My god was going nuts and my cat hid under the couch while we chased the stray around trying to get it out.	0 
Did you eventually get it out? I would have been flipping bonkers! 	1 
This has been the worst year ever for tornadoes in our area. This past spring we spent 5 hours in our basement due to all the tornadoes in our area.	0 
That sounds terrifying! Im glad you have a basement though_comma_ it can be so dangerous if you have no underground place to shelter in!	0 
Yes_comma_ a lot of people don't have basements_comma_ and that would be really bad. It's hard to explain to a three year old why you are in such a dark_comma_ scary place_comma_ especially when the power is all out.	0 
Oh your right_comma_ I have an almost 3 year old and I wouldn't know how to explain it as well! That is so hard sometimes because you don't know what to say!	1 
I was in the grocery store. I found what I needed on the top shelf. I climbed onto the bottom shelf but ended up knocking everything down!	0 
Oh my goodness_comma_ are you alright? I bet you created a mess!	0

I hope you can laugh a little about it now!	1

Wow. I am sure you will remember this for a long time. You are going to have to think of a great surprise for him now.	0 
I know! I wasn't really planning to do much this year hahaha	1 
Last month_comma_ my dog Duke passed away. I got him when he was just a puppy 17 years ago.	0 
I'm sorry to hear about that. It sounds like_comma_ to me_comma_ that he lived a long life with you though_comma_ and that you were able to spend a lot of time with him. I'm worried for my girlfriend and what she'll do when that happens to her and her dog	0 
Yeah_comma_ we did everything together. I still have to stop myself from calling him when I go to bed at night. It's amazing how close we can get to our pets.	0 
That's crazy_comma_ and a little heart-breaking too. I'm envious of the bond and routine it sounds like you guys had. I have yet to develop a bond like that with a pet. I hope I do at some point	1 
I was driving around my old neighborhood and seen that the house I grew up in had burned down.	0 
That's so sad...Did you have a lot of good memories in that house?	0 
I spent birth till I was 17 living there_comma_ so literally all of my child hood memories. 	0 
I'm so sorry :( At least you have your memories to look back on.	1 
my wife got a flat tire on her way home from work and a man was kind enough to stop and help her change the tire.	0 
That was really nice of him. I know that she had to be relieved.	0 
As was I. I was about 50 miles away at the time and she was on the side of the highway.	0 
Someone was watching over her.	1 
Just over 2 years ago_comma_ my wife and I got divorced. It was so strange being in our big house all alone without her and the kids.	0 
How long had you been married ?	0 
Just short of 9 years. She met someone online in WoW of all places and just up and moved in with him.	0 
Hmm. That's a bit of a strange story.	1 
Back when I was in college_comma_ I crossed a street in wrong place and got a ticket.	0 
I hate to hear that. I hate tickets. There are so many other things I would rather spend my money on.	0 
Exactly_comma_ especially when you get one for just walking.	0 
Yeah_comma_ that is such a silly thing to get a ticket for.	1 
My wife and I are going to buy are very first brand new car this week.	0 
Cool_comma_ what are you getting?	0 
A Chevy Cruze. We have been working hard to get our credit score up to get a really good interest rate.	0

I took my three children camping recently_comma_ and we had a great time.	0 
Neat! We took our daughter and her cousin camping about 2 weeks ago! Did ya'll build a fire?	0 
Of course!  I have found that the key to a great camping experience is to have a checklist of what to bring_comma_ and follow it.	0 
That's defiantly a priority! I hope you brought everything that you need. Forgetting something can be a pain	1 
My daughter finally master the 1-6 times. We worked very hard on it this summer!	0 
The 1-6 times as in multiplication?  Teaching children is so rewarding.	0 
Yes in multiplication! I'm glad she's finally grasped them. Now we just need to work on 6-12 hahaha	0 
I bet she was super excited to get it all down.	0 
She was!	1 
My daughter starts public school for the first time in 3 years! I think she is going to do great but she's a little bit nervous.	0 
What grade is she in?	0 
She is in 5th grade.	0 
What kind of school was she at before?	0 
We have been homeschooling. I'm having to go back to work now_comma_ so she's not too happy about it. I think she will be just fine that. She's well socialized 	1 
Me and my family just came back from vacation we had a great time.	0 
Where did you go ?	0 
We went to Disney world in Orlando_comma_Fl to see my kids have a great time made me happy can't wait for our next vacation.	0 
We went there a few years back. Had a great time.	1 
Well_comma_ I finally got a call back from that job I interviewed for the other day.	0 
Awesome news!  What was the response?	0 
Well_comma_ they decided not to hire me. This stinks.	0 
Oh.  Not so good news then :(  I'm sorry.  I'm sure you'll find something!	1 
My wife held a surprise birthday party for me. It was totally unexpected and I was shocked when I came home and so many people were there.	0 
That's awesome_comma_ I bet you were overjoyed with it!	0 
I couldn't believe that no one let the cat out of the bag. It must have been hard to plan.	0 
You never know if someone is going to slip and spoil it for you_comma_ that's true!	1 
Last week during the night someone came into my yard and stole my push mower.	0 
Oh no!  Do you have any way of finding out who did it?	0 
No_comma_ I called the police but it's almost impossible to track. I had to chained to a steel post_comma_ but they cut the chain with bolt cutters I guess. I sure hate thieves.	0 
Yeah_comma_ thieves are terrible.  I mean_comma_ who would steal a mower?	1 
My food had hair in it at a restaurant worst experience ever.	0 
what did you do?	0 
I called the manager over and they offered to redo the food and pay for it but I was so sicken and upset I said no thank you it ruined my whole appetite. 	0 
yea i can see that_comma_ it happens but it sucks	1 
I'm not one to like scary movies that much only with my husband since he loves them so much.	0

Oh no_comma_ no thank you! lol ahhh i cant even. 	1 
My wife is going away on a business trip soon.... she'll be gone for a couple of weeks.	0 
That'll be tough.  Do you have anything you can do to keep busy?	0 
Well_comma_ I might do some work on the house. But it's going to be awfully quiet around here.	0 
I bet.  It's sometimes surprising how much your life revolves around the other person being in the house.	1 
Ugh_comma_ my neighbor keeps playing his music really loud at night when I'm trying to sleep.	0 
spray water over there	0 
Ha_comma_ that's not a bad idea. I do need to have a word with him about it though at least.	0 
thats good_comma_ you should	1 
Someone at work keeps stealing my lunch from the fridge! So infuriating!	0 
Could you get with your HR department to see if they can assist?	0 
I might give that a try. But whoever did it had probably better hope that I don't find out who they are!	0 
What would you do to them?	0 
Well nothing too serious_comma_ but I'd definitely have a word or two with them!	1 
I don't like the dark.	0 
Yea_comma_ I used to hate it too.	0 
I get so worried about something happening to me.	0 
Like a paranormal type fear or a human with intent to harm type fear?	0 
More of a human with intent to harm type fear.	1 
I've been stuck for several weeks on a part in this video game I've been playing...	0 
is it really hard? or you just have not have that much time to paly	0 
It's pretty tough. But it doesn't matter now... I let a friend of mine have a try_comma_ and he got through it right away! It was pretty impressive to see.	0 
yeah some people are just naturaly good at video games	1 
So the fiance managed to rewire one of the wall outlets yesterday!	0 
That's pretty impressive_comma_ does he have any training or just all self taught?	0

Well it's certainly nice to have someone around with handy knowledge like that!	1 
Ugh_comma_ my neighbor's dog just keeps barking all day long. It's driving me insane.	0 
That is frustrating!  We have a couple down the street that raises hunting dogs.  So annoying all day!	0 
It really is. And I've talked to him a few times about it_comma_ but he doesn't seem to care at all.	0 
I am sure he thinks it's his world_comma_ the rules dont apply to him.  Sorry you have to deal with that people can be so rude	1 
My brother is getting out of jail next week.	0 
Well you must be happy about it.	0 
Not really... I'm the one that turned him in. And I'm scared that he might know about that.	0 
Oh! that is bad then.  Be careful.	1 
I have a Dr appointment tomorrow to make sure my cancer is still in remission.	0 
I hope you hear good news.	0

I understand. I guess you'll always feel that way.	1 
My brother is supposed to be paying me back for the food I bought for him last week...	0 
It was nice of you to buy him food_comma_ but I'm thinking he didn't pay you back.	0 
Nope_comma_ I've been waiting for a few days_comma_ and I could really use that money now.	0 
I'm sorry. I know it sucks to need money and be counting on it_comma_ and then you don't get it. I hope he pays you back soon.	1 
I stepped out of my front door this morning... and right into an unpleasant surprise that my neighbor's dog left for me.	0 
Ugh! I use to have the same problem with my neighbors dog who would poop in my driveway! At least it was my tires and not my feet that got the unpleasant surprise.	0 
Yeah.... the smell was so bad. It took forever to get that off of my shoe.	0 
Does this happen often? I'd let my neighbor know about it.	1 
I got a phone call from a friend that I haven't heard from in a really long time.	0 
That's great! You must have been so surprised and pleased to hear from them.	0 
I was! It was so great hearing from her again.	0 
I bet you had tons of catching up to do!	1 
I have a meeting with my boss in a few hours...	0 
The way you wrote that makes it seem like you're anticipating something bad... Do you mind if I ask what you're expecting to happen?	0 
See_comma_ that's the thing... I have no idea what to expect. That's why I'm so nervous about it.	0 
Interesting... well then at least that leaves the possibility for something good instead. If you're not sure what it could be_comma_ then at least it's not some obvious mistake or negligence on your part. I hope for the best for you	1 
My mother is getting very old. And she really isn't in great health these days...	0 
That is unfortunate_comma_ my own mother was ill for several years_comma_ she is getting older as well. Do you get to see her often?	0 
Yeah_comma_ I try to go see her at least twice a week. I'm not sure how much longer she'll be with us.	0 
Just spend what time you can with her_comma_ I'd like to say something really profound but aging parents is a situation that just sucks. Sorry you are having to deal with it.	1 
When I was out of work my car broke down and since it was my only car a friend of mine actually gave me his old car to replace it. It was such a nice gesture.	0 
That was great of him!	0 
It was. I insisted that I pay him after I got a job but he wouldn't take the money.	0 
He sounds very nice!	1 
I finished a major work assignment in a short amount of time	0 
Oh really what was the assignment	0 
It was a presentation that had to be quickly put together.  My supervisor seemed pleased	0 
It's always great to get back positive feedback!	1 
I remember when the PS4 was first launching.  It was the first game console I ever ordered onilne and I was really looking forward to having it delivered.	0 
What was it like when it showed up on your door?	0 
I was watching the front door like a hawk_comma_ and constantly checking for online tracking updates.  I kept worrying that someone would steal it of my porch if I didn't get it right away.	0 
Thats hilarious_comma_ You finally got it though uhuh?	0 
Oh yeah.  As soon as I heard the knock I flung the door open and snatched it in a hurry.	1 
A friend was supposed to meet me for lunch_comma_ but didn't show	0 
Im sure they had a good excuse.	0 
He said he was busy with work_comma_ so I suppose so	0 
Oh I see. Hopefully its just that one time where he couldnt get to his phone to let you know.	1 
I accidentally left my phone at a restaurant	0 
Oh crap! how long untill you realized?	0 
A few minutes after leaving_comma_ I was able to get it back	0 
Thats so good_comma_ man I have done that a time of two.	1 
I'm sure I will pass my law exam.	0 
I am sure you will as well. Confidence is great!	0 
Thank you. I'm almost done with school!	0 
Congratulations. You have done great!	1 
A friend got a new car	0 
That's really cool. What kind of car?	0 
BMW_comma_ it was a model I had been looking to get myself 	0 
That  sounds like a really awesome car!	1 
I carry around the ticket stub from the first concert I attended in my wallet.  It brings back good memories I had spending time with my friends.	0 
Aww_comma_ that's really sweet and sentimental. I like that. Can you still read the words on it?	0 
The edges are a little frayed but I can still make out everything on it.  I keep it in a zippered compartment to preserve it.  Maybe I'll frame it someday.	0 
I was going to say_comma_ yeah_comma_ that's the kind of thing I would love to preserve in a frame or something for my office. How cool!	0 
Yeah_comma_ it's a nice little souvenir to remind me of good times.  It was a great concert and experience for all of us.	0 
Who did you go see? And are you still friends with all the same people? I wonder if any of them kept their ticket stubs too.	0 
We went to see Incubus_comma_ it was our favorite band going through high school.  I went with my best friends who I'm still best friends with_comma_ and they actually did keep theirs too. 	1 
Hey_comma_ the other day I didn't have a pen while trying to fill out some paperwork	0

That is great. What was the issue with your ear?	0 
Thanks! I had a bone that had fused inside my ear and made me deaf_comma_ and they replaced it with a titanium piston!	1

you made quick work out of that	0 
Yeah_comma_ I was really happy that the unloading took as little time as it did.	0 
i wish i could unload that fast	1

On no! Did you have to walk_comma_ or did you call for service?	0 
A nice man stopped_comma_ help me push my car to the shoulder and even had a can of gas he let me use in his trunk. Talk about a nice guy.	0 
Wow_comma_ you got lucky! Did you give him a tip?	1 
I got caught cheating on my test. I feel so horrible.	0 
Why did you feel you had to cheat? I am sure you could have passed if you had studied.	0 
I just wanted to make sure I passed. But now I have a big 0.	0 
Well_comma_ don't let this one situation define you. Use it as a learning experience and move on_comma_ and do you best not to repeat it.	1 
I had an accident today and I never want to show my face again at work.	0 
That's so sad! What on earth happened?	0 
I accidentally peed my pants when I was laughing. 	0 
Now that is quite embarrassing! What did your co-workers say?	0 
They all laughed and posted it on facebook.	1 
My daughter made straight A's all year. I am so happy.	0 
That is wonderful!  She must be so proud of herself and I know you are proud of her.  Its great that she likes learning so much.	0 
Yes I agree. I let her choose our vacation this summer. She cried because she was so happy.	0 
Awww_comma_ what a great idea!  That's so cute! Where are you guys going?	1 
I could never send my parents to a nursing home. I look after them now.	0 
You are such a good person to do that!	0 
Thank you! They say they feel like they are the kids and it makes them feel young again.	0 
It's crazy how the tables turn!	1 
I think I will never walk into the local grocery store again.	0 
Why do you say that	0 
It was raining today_comma_ and when I walked into the store I slipped and fell right on my face.	0 
Oh no_comma_ were you okay	1 
I can't show my face in the bank ever again!	0 
Oh my goodness_comma_ what happened? Did they find out you owe money to the local crime families? Those bank employees need to mind their own business_comma_ am I right!?	0 
How did you guess? You are exactly right. Now they are talking about alerting the police!	0 
That is absolutely unacceptable. Snitches get stitches_comma_ that's what I say. Tell me where they're at and I'll roll up on 'em and tell 'em what for. Just say the word. I've got your back.	1 
I need someone to stay with my elderly mother for a few hours in my home. 	0 
have you asked your friends for family?	0 
No one is available. She asked someone that I don't know and they are coming. I am a little uneasy.	0 
i would def feel that way.its hard when you dont know the person or can trust them	0 
I guess I just have to hope for the best and hope I don't get robbed or worse.	1 
My husband just told me the best news ever!	0 
Oh yeah? And what news might that be?	0 
My husband just signed with the NFL. I never knew he was that good!	0 
Nice! Did he sign up to be a waterboy?	1 
So_comma_ I just found our my husband is cheating on me.	0 
Oh my goodness_comma_ that's terrible!	0 
I am soo mad. I can't believe he did this after being married for 15 years.	0 
What do you plan on doing?	1 
I don't think I will go outside in the dark ever again.	0 
uh oh. did something happen?	0 
Yes_comma_ I was robbed at gun point while walking home from work.	0 
That must be traumatizing. Most people wouldn't want to go out alone after that. It's understandable.	1 
I have been pacing waiting to hear back from Walmart after my interview. 	0 
Do you think you will get the job?	0 
Not sure_comma_ but I really need this job to support my kids.	0 
I hope you end up getting it!	1

Oh definitely_comma_ Youtube is a great platform for these talented people	0 
Yeah_comma_ it never ceases to amaze me the kinds of things you can see on YouTube.  Endless content to discover.	0 
Yeah_comma_ my favorite is watching short comedy videos of my favorite drag queens	0

I can never thank my mom enough.	0 
Why? What did she do?	0 
She helped us pay off our house so it didn't go into foreclosure. 	0 
She is a special woman.	1 
I am not sure how to address to my husband about how I feel about him getting a phone number from another girl.	0 
I would be downright furious. Start by smacking him across the face randomly at dinner. That should be a good segway into the conversation.	0 
That is how I feel. I don't think he understands how it makes me feel inside. 	0 
Oh_comma_ he certainly will when he feels the hot_comma_ guilty tears running down his face from that strong_comma_ independent_comma_ jealous filled slap!	1 
I am still in shock at the damage yesterdays flood caused. 	0 
Was any of your stuff damaged?	0 
Yes_comma_ our whole house was swept out to sea.	0

I know I got this job_comma_ just waiting for the conformation. 	0 
Exciting! Are you moving to a new company?	0 
No_comma_ this is the first job I have ever had just out of high school.	0 
Oh fun! I'm so excited for you. Try to learn as much as possible from this job and ask for career development opportunities!	1 
I never thought I would see something this gross ever!	0 
Oh geez! What on earth was it!	0 
I saw a guy pick a piece of chewed gum off the sidewalk and put it in his mouth.	0 
That is FRIGGIN revolting!!! I would have lost my lunch right then and there!	1 
Today_comma_ was the worst day ever!	0 
No way. What happened? If honestly_comma_ almost all my days are like this. So_comma_ worst has become normal for me	0 
That is so sad. I was turned down for my promotion at work to someone with less experience than me. 	0 
Don't get it personally. Good performance will always catch other's attention. Just continue doing your work	1 
I am pretty happy with my life right now.	0 
That's awesome! Always good to be content with life.	0 
It took a long time. But I always tell people to plan for the future! 	0 
It's good to be prepared for anything because you never know what could happen.	1 
I never knew I would feel this much love having kids.	0 
Definately! I have one daughter and twins on the way... I foresee love overload. How many do you have?	0

Well you tried to make things right_comma_ you're still a good person	1 
Do you feel that you are satisfied with your work	0

Great! I am very happy with work_comma_ I am loving it	0 
im glad to hear that!	0 
Thank you so much	1 
I would be in bad shape if I didn't pack extra clothes.	0 
What are you packing extra clothes for? Did you go somewhere did something happen?	0 
We went on vacation. And we all ended up with the stomach virus so you can guess from there lol	0 
What are you packing extra clothes for? Did you go somewhere did something happen?	1 
I am still shocked my husband bought tickets to the concert.	0

Well I hope nothing crazy happens and you guys stay safe!	1 
my husband threw me an unexpected party for my birthday!	0 
Wow_comma_ that's very nice of him! Was there a lot of people there?	0 
Yes almost my entire family! The only one that wasn't there was my son. He couldn't come because he had to work.	0 
That's too bad. I hope you had a blast!	0 
I did! We had pizza_comma_ cake_comma_ chips_comma_ all kinds of goodies that I love.	1 
There is suppose to be a huge storm coming. I went to the store and got supplies so i am ready.	0 
That's a good idea! It's always smart to be on the safe side.	0 
We usually don't have horrible storms so i never do it_comma_ but i have heard this one is going to be a bad one.  i just want to be ready	0

Only one way to find out.	1 
My son is getting ready to go into the military! I am so pleased with him	0 
What branch of the military then?	0 
The marines. He has always wanted to join.  I am glad he is finally getting to. 	0 
The marines is by far my favorite so good for him!	1 
My electricity is out again! I pay a lot for the service_comma_ and i can never count on it. It goes out when the wind blows!	0 
Oh no that's horrible. Have you complained to the electric company?	0 
Yes but i always get the same answer_comma_ we are working to improve the infrastructure.. blah blah. I am seriously considering solar.	0 
I would too at this point. It might be more reliable.	1 
I think I am going to have to serve on a jury and I am terrified	0

I think it's a good outlook.	1 
I almost adopted a child once_comma_ but now I'm glad I didn't do it_comma_ sometimes we should stay rational.	0 
Hopefully one day you might decide to choose otherwise or have a child of your own.	0 
I don't know if this is something I'll ever be ready for.	0 
It's a tough choice to make_comma_ and not everyone has to raise a child.	1 
Have you ever mistaken a situation for something it is not and was ready for anything?	0 
i can say that i have mistaken something for what it isnt. but not sure about the ready for anything	0 
It's just that the other day I mistaken a guard for a tour guide and almost got in a fight.	0 
almost? so the situation resolved itself?	1 
I have an interview with a local ad agency tomorrow. I hope I get it!	0 
What kind of interview?	0

well i came back from work kind of sad because i thought nobody remembered my birthday and as soon as i went inside they screamed happy birthday _comma_ not gonna lie i got really happy.	0 
I bet you needed help to take all the presents back home.	1 
I got into a wrong part of town the other day_comma_ I was glad to get out from there.	0 
oh my god_comma_ how did you get out of there?	0 
I realized I could walk very fast if I want to.	0 
that sounds great.	1 
In the past and even today I always felt strong in unfamiliar situations.	0 
That's a great asset to have emotionally I think.	0 
I agree_comma_ although I don't really know if you can train yourself to be like that.	0 
Yeah it might just be something you're born with.	1 
I have old cassette player and music on it is much better than what I hear on a radio today. 	0 
I agree. Music used to have soul and good lyrics back in the day.	0 
Yes_comma_ today it's just all about money and getting physical.	0 
Hopefully music nowadays can take a note from the good old days and change their tune.	1 
yesterday i went to the town where i grew up 	0 
how did that go? did it bring back a lot of memories?	0 
it did_comma_ so much nostalgia!	0 
im glad to hear that. sounds like a great trip	1 
So it was supposed to rain_comma_ but when I got out it was beautifully sunny.	0 
Almost sounds like the erratic weather that we have here in Georgia.  I don't mind the rain as long as I'm inside.  The sun is beautiful but sometimes it can be brutal when it starts to heat up.  Do you prefer sunny days?	0 
Sun is what makes me alive_comma_ so definitely yes.	0 
I have to be very careful in the sun.  My allergies and the sun don't mix too well.  I can tolerate the rain much better.  I love the sound of water.	1 
When I walk past old people I feel fortunate that I'm still young.	0 
i can agree with that. i do feel the effects of age creeping up on me though	0 
Yes_comma_ but this part is inevitable_comma_ for now let us enjoy our young years.	0 
def. make the best of them	1 
When I feel an urge to get a girlfriend_comma_ I simply remember how nice it is to be independent.	0 
It's good to explore your own interests and what makes you grow on your own.	0 
Yes_comma_ I still think that there are good and bad sides in both of these cases.	0 
Hopefully one day you will be willing to explore a relationship in a serious way.	1 
I get angry when people don't use trash cans.	0 
I once volunteered to pick up trash on the side of the road. It's amazing how much people litter	0 
Good for you_comma_ instead of tickets this should be a punishment for everyone.	0 
I wish. People might have more respect if they were forced to clean up other people's trash as well.	1 
When I wake up_comma_ the first thing I do is thank life for having another day to enjoy.	0 
Are you in a dangerous place?	0 
No I'm not_comma_ but in away we all are in a very dangerous place_comma_ aren't we?	0 
I suppose so. It's great that you value life so much!	1 
i was with my friend yesterday and by accident i spilled coffee on her laptop	0 
Oh no. Did it get ruined?	0 
i got so embarrassed but thankfully it didn't get ruined	0 
Close call. I once spilt tea over my laptop and the keys were all sticky for a while	1 
my grandmother passed away last week.	0 
Really? So sorry for the lose	0 
i'm really sad because she used to help me with everything 	0 
Was she sick?	0 
yeah. heart problems	1 
I entered a contest and I didn't win.	0 
That's a bummer. It's never fun to not win.	0 
No it isn't. I felt like I put a lot of effort into it too.	0 
Hopefully you'll have better luck next time!	1 
we changed our internet provider last week and the connection is horrible.	0 
That's not good_comma_ we ended up lucky with who we have 	0 
i wish we did too.. but it's okay 	0 
Maybe you can find another one or go back to your previous company. Have you double checked with the company to make sure everything is ok? 	0 
i haven't _comma_ i guess i'll do it later today	1 
I was one of three finalists for a job promotion where I work. I have more than double the other candidates experience_comma_ so I feel really good about my odds.	0 
that's wonderful! I hope you will get that promotion! What do you do?	0 
I am a electrical engineer with more than 15 years experience. I have a really good feeling that I am going to get this job.	0 
Good luck! Whenever you get that promotion we should go celebrate	1 
i can't wait for summer to finish _comma_ i love winter so much	0 
I agree_comma_ plus I love making snowmen! 	0 
snowmen are my favourite! 	0 
I always get sad though when they melt 	1 
Last week I was walking and talking to one of my coworkers and I stepped into a hole I did not see on the job site. I ended up falling and spilling hot coffee all over myself in front of our client.	0 
Ouch! Did they try to help you back up?	0 
Yeah_comma_ my coworker did_comma_ but the damage had already been done. Pretty big shot to the ego to look like such a fool in front of your client.	0 
Of course! Well_comma_ at least you also looked human. We all make mistakes.	1 
We have had a record number of tornadoes in my area so far this year. My son really hates going into the basement while it is storming outside.	0 
That sounds really scary!  Is your son afraid or is he use to it?	0 
He is only three_comma_ so it is pretty scary for him each time. I hate to see him that way.	0 
I would hate that as well. I hope he learns to cope with it.	1 
I had a client meeting in Dallas_comma_ and as I was driving to the airport I heard there was going to be a lot of storms we'd be flying through. I ended up renting a car because I hate flying so much in just calm weather.	0 
That is a lot of extra money to spen_comma_ but it is completely understandable it you are that nervous about it.  Have you ever looked into calming medications_comma_ or meditation to help your nerves?	0 
I have_comma_ but they only cut down the anxiety instead of making it go away completely. Something about hurdling towards earth at a rapid pace in a large metal box alarms me.	0 
I completely understand that.  My mother in law used to have really bad anxiety about flying_comma_ but she did hypnosis and it really helped. 	1 
Last month_comma_ this area got pounded with rainfall. My entire home town was flooded and declared a disaster area.	0 
Wow. That's intense. Did your home get any damage?	0 
No_comma_ I move away from there some years ago_comma_ but I hate seeing the place I grew up basically destroyed now.	0 
Yeah. I feel for you. It hurts to lose things like that.	1 
My birthday isn't for another two weeks_comma_ but my wife gave me my gift early yesterday. She bought me a brand new laptop because mine was getting old and slow.	0 
That is awesome.  Happy Birthday!  What kind is it?	0 
It's a Dell with a I7 and 8 gigs of ram_comma_ even has a Nvidia graphics card. She pretty much know what I wanted.	0 
Is that a gaming computer?	1 
Last month our area received record amounts of rainfall. The river that is down from my house backed up so bad it flooded my entire house destroying practically everything.	0 
Sorry to hear about that. Are the damages covered by an insurance?	0 
Yes_comma_ we had insurance that is going to cover it_comma_ but it still sucks start from ground zero. Plus_comma_ insurance can't really replace some things.	0 
I understand. It is always difficult to start from ground zero. Good luck.	1 
My ex took me to six flags and wanted me to ride on a very high roller coaster.	0 
Interesting....did you do it	0 
Yeah_comma_ but only because he was getting mad at me. I hate heights and I was very unsure about it.	0 
lol why would he get mad...but did you have fun in the end	1 
My husband is so lucky I cheat on him like he did.	0 
Why do you cheat on him?	0 
I could have. But I didn't. He cheated on me actually.	0 
Oh I see_comma_ why are you still with him then?	1 
Damn_comma_ I really wanted my eBay package to arrive today_comma_ but it didn't.	0 
I know how you feel. Are you also spoiled by amazone prime?	0 
Indeed_comma_ I thought everything came this early.	0 
Haha_comma_ I know. Especially when I purchase firearms related things like ammunition. It has to ship ground.  1 week for shipping?!?!   rage.	0 
That sucks! I guess ground shipping takes ages in large countries. 	0 
Yeah_comma_ the US is huge_comma_ landmass wise.	0 
I really really wished it would come today_comma_ I was even sat at the window looking for postal trucks and everything!	0 
You can always leave them an angry review online	1 
I got so mad at my dog the other day.	0 
What did your dog do?	0 
He saw the rabbit that lives under my shed eating some grass in my yard_comma_ and decided to scare it and chase it away.	0 
Oh no_comma_ well at least he didnt hurt the rabbit.	0 
You're right_comma_ it could have been much worse. I am thankful in a way.	1 
I am so upset about what happened yesterday. 	0 
What happened to you?	0 
I accidentally can off the road avoiding a deer and totaled my new car.	0 
That sucks sorry to hear. Are you okay?	1 
I went to my first concert this weekend I seen Beyonce herself it was so awesome. 	0 
Oh nice! I bet you'll remember that for a long time	0 
Yes and I will it was great and her voice and the singers really moved me because even in person it was lovely. 	0 
I've never been to a concert. I should go see one like you!	1 
This past weekend I found out a friend of mine I went to school with passed away. He had a heart attack while he slept.	0 
that's terrible! how does that make you feel?	0 
It makes me feel old. I mean I am not that old_comma_ but to see people my age passing away really makes me think about my own mortality. 	0 
That is the reality of life_comma_ unfortunately! That's what you have to enjoy life now.	1 
I am upset I have to tell my daughter her pet died.	0 
That is terrible. How long have you had this pet?	0 
She had it for 2 years. But I feel I must be honest with her.	0 
Honesty is vey important. I hope she will not feel too bad.	1 
I can't believe my husband planned a trip all by him. 	0 
Where are you going?	0 
I am still shocked he planned a cruise for 7 days.	0 
That is going to be so fun!	1 
I start my diet Monday and let's just say I am not ready to start lol.	0 
I am never ready. which diet are you trying	0 
The keto diet and I have started looking up meal preps and workouts but as of non I am so not arranged to start this up I need more time.	0 
I think my favorite and easiest would have to be Atkins but still alot of prep to get started	0 
I have to look into that one never heard of it thanks.	0 
your welcome_comma_ and I will check out Keto.	1 
My dogs are my life more like my family I love them.	0 
My kitties are my family too. Animals are the best.	0 
Yes they are you can't be lonely with them they are just so warmhearted and loving always. 	0 
Exactly! I am glad you have them	1 
I can't believe my husband hid a talent her had from me for 15 years. 	0 
That sounds interesting.. What was it? And how did you find out? And why did he hide it! If you don't mind me asking_comma_ of course...	0 
I happen to come across all his drawings. He is as good as most professional artists! 	0 
Oh I see.. Well that's a pretty positive talent then_comma_ huh? Maybe you should encourage him to keep doing it. Maybe he misses it. You could get him a present for his birthday or Christmas that was related to drawing tools/pencils and all that.	1 
I am starting back dancing ballet next month it's been a while since I last danced. 	0 
how is that working out for you	0 
A little rusty but I know when I get in the class and hit the floor with my shoes I am more then positive it will be great.	0 
practice makes perfect	1 
I hate I keep receiving double bills every month from Comcast.	0 
omg i would be upset too... how many times have you called them to fix it? 	0 
Every month they shut off my service because I didn't pay the second bill. Then I have to go all over this month after month of them fixing their errors.	0 
Sounds like a nightmare! total. 	1 
When I see my wedding picture around the house I always think back to that day.	0 
Does it make you feel happy about your life since then?	0 
Yeah_comma_ just makes me think back to those times and how it was so different from now.	0 
Well at least you'll always have your memories as time goes on.	1 
My favorite football team lost their preseason game and I talked so much smack to everyone saying they was going to win. 	0 
that's why i don't watch sports lol we always make fun of our uncle because he talks a lot of smack and die hard Redskins fan	0 
I love the Jaguars I was ashamed I talk a lot of smack to everyone lol I guess me and your uncle need to stay quite next time lol.	0 
lol no! you shouldn't! that's the best part! Talking smack to each other	0 
You're right I'm going to be even louder next time.	1 
I dislike a careless driver and this morning I was furious with one by my daughters elementary school. 	0 
Oh I know how you feel! I wish there was some kind of hotline where you could report a license plate to law enforcement so they would get in trouble for being stupid with kids around	0 
I wish to and the school zone light was flashing but they was driving past the 15 mph minimum a child could have got hurt.	0 
Thats awful! People should be arrested for that	1 
I lost some money yesterday in the parking lot I am still so unhappy about that.	0 
Oh no!  Devastating! I'm so sorry.	0 
I know it is I lost $100 and was actually on the way to pay my car insurance with that can't believe I was careless. 	0 
That makes me feel ill so I'm sure you were sick. I hope somehow you make it up!	1 
I decided to buy my son's supplies for kindergarten_comma_ they wanted very specific brands/counts.	0 
That could turn out expensive. Did they need a particular brand for a particular reason?	0 
I'm not sure_comma_ it was just on the list.  I had a really hard time finding them.	0 
That's annoying_comma_ maybe they should provide links for you next time?	1 
I just got out of a job interview for a customer assistant role.	0 
How did it go?	0 
I think it went well_comma_ apart from a few mistakes_comma_ hopefully I got the job.	0 
That is great.  Interviews are very intimidating. 	1 
I recently had to babysit my cousins_comma_ it was a disaster.	0 
Oh no_comma_ what happened?	0 
They made a mess everywhere in the house. Really was not a good way to earn money.	0 
There has o be an easier way.  I have always avoided babysitting because I just don't like other peoples kids that much.	0 
Yeah_comma_ kids are super annoying to deal with_comma_ I've learned a lesson_comma_ ha!	1 
Yesterday was my birthday and I knew my girlfriend had a surprise planned for me_comma_ but no idea what it would be.	0 
So i am guessing she gave you a good surprise?	0 
An awesome one! All my best friends were there and I got some pretty sweet gifts!	0 
She's must be a keeper then.	0 
I definitely think so!	1 
Against all odds_comma_ I won two tickets to go to a music festival last summer.	0 
That is awesome.  I have never won anything in my life.  What festival was it?	0 
That's a shame! It was a festival called Pooza Fest. Many punk-rock and acoustic shows!	0 
Congratulations!  Did you have a good time?	0 
I did_comma_ thanks for asking. I went with my older brother and a few of his friends. It was a blast!	1 
I won a pair of tickets to go to Rockfest this summer.	0 
wow thats awesome.  How did you win them? I never win anything cool.	0 
I won them by sharing and liking a facebook page! Unfortunately_comma_ none of my friends could go and so I ended up staying home instead.	0 
aww that stinks_comma_ i hope you were at least able to sell them and make some money	0 
They were tied to my name_comma_ so I couldn't even sell them. Oh well!	1 
My coworker constantly calls in.  The last couple weeks he had only come in on Fridays.  We made a friendly bet last night if he would come in today and I was pretty shocked when he actually was here on a Wednesday.	0 
That is crazy! How is he still employed?	0 
He went on disability.  He actually was my old roommate so I know he just doesnt like working but at the same time has anxiety issues so he can go that route to not get fired.  It definitely doesnt look good for him though.	0 
That makes people look bad. I have severe anxiety and still go to work. I get that things are hard but.... its bad to never come in.	1 
I told my best friends about an incident in where I self-harmed recently.	0 
I am glad that you spoke out and shared your feelings. Its not healthy to self harm and pent up your feelings.	0 
Agreed. I was anxious and scared to share_comma_ but I'm glad I did; they were really supportive and it's helped me a lot.	0 
Thats what best friends are for_comma_ after all. I hope things have gotten better for you.	0 
They have_comma_ ever since I started taking meds and speaking to my doctor and social worker. This is also the reason why I think you should confide in a professional_comma_ it can really turn your life around and you deserve the best!	1 
My dog keeps going into my garbage and throwing it all onto the floor!	0 
Gesh_comma_ that's frustrating. I had a dog that used to do that too. Had to get a trash can with a lid.	0 
That's a good idea_comma_ I just haven't found a nice looking one yet. It's really frustrating but I think I'll just get whatever I can at this point.	0 
We even had to put something heavy on top of the lid to keep it from getting in it. Hopefully that will work for now until you figure something out.	0 
Thanks for the suggestions_comma_ I'm going to give them a shot!	1 
An eagle landed on my flag pole in my front yard last week!	0 
That is awe inspiring_comma_ very patriotic.  Did you get pictures?	0 
I did. Not the best pictures because I was using my phone but still_comma_ it was really surprising.	0 
I'm sure_comma_ that isn't something you see every day_comma_ or would even expect to see ever.  I'm glad you got it documented.	1 
I've been putting off my exam studying by being productive in other areas of my life.	0 
Well_comma_ that's great. But you probably should study as well. School is very important.	0 
Yeah... I'm pretty upset in myself for procrastinating_comma_ but also proud of what I've been accomplishing. I'm so conflicted in my emotions.	0 
Yeah_comma_ that does sound like a conflicting situation. Well at least you're doing something positive.	1 
I was helping my girlfriend pack up her sons toys and he had a lite-brite.  I used to have a lite-brite and loved playing with it when I was younger.  It brought back some good memories.	0 
I bought a lite brite from goodwill about a year ago. It was one of the remakes from recent years but we had fun with it.	0 
His is a new version too...those toys that were older were sooo much better but at least kids today can have an idea of how awesome they were back then!	0 
Nope_comma_ they only know how to touch screens.	1 
My girlfriend moved in last weekend.  I really feel like this is the right move for the next steps for us and our relationship.	0 
That's great! How long have you two been together?	0 
Almost a year.  We're a little bit older though so I dont feel like its a rush into a relationship sort of thing.	0 
You learn a lot about someone when you move in with them_comma_ so if you feel comfortable in your relationship I think that's actually rather prudent.	1 
A friend of mine hadn't taken out her garbage in weeks.	0 
Oh I'll bet that didn't smell pleasant.	0 
You got that right. Also there were so many fruit flies around it_comma_ I felt sick to my stomach.	0 
Oh gross.  I hope she won't do that again.	1 
I really hate moving. My girlfriend just moved in last weekend. Im really happy she moved in but Im also SUPER happy that the move is finally over.	0 
Moving is the worst.  All those boxes.  ugh. i hope i dont have to do it for awhile	0 
Haha_comma_ the boxes are still being unpacked and probably will be for the next couple weeks.  I'm hoping we dont have to again for a while!	0 
I hope its good that she moved in with you.  things must be serious	1 
I was lucky enough to get an opportunity to volunteer for one of my favorite companies at a convention.	0 
That sounds pretty amazing_comma_ what convention was it?	0 
Otakuthon 2018. It was so amazing_comma_ I ended up doing really great!	0 
I'm so happy for you_comma_ it sounds like it was a wonderful opportunity!	1 
i was looking at my old photo album today_comma_ it brought back a lot of memories	0 
That is always so much fun. Which ones made you feel the most nostalgic?	0 
the one where i was eating ice cream_comma_ oh god i miss eating ice cream	0 
I know how you feel. I feel guilty about indulging in ice cream the older I get.	1 
I went for a run last month and the most unexpected thing happened to me.	0 
Oh yes? What happened?	0 
I was running on a road with a sidewalk_comma_ I turned the corner and saw a deer staring at me. Can't believe I found one in my small suburban neighborhood.	0 
Oh_comma_ that must have been so precious! We had deer around where I used to live - they're gorgeous creatures.	1 
My little brother was stuck gaming on a horrendously slow computer for years.	0 
That's not much fun. Did he get a new one recently?	0 
Kind of. I built myself a new PC_comma_ and gave him my previous one. I re-built it for him and made sure everything would work perfectly!	0 
Wow_comma_ you're smart and kind! I wouldn't know where to start re. building a computer. Well done!	0 
Thanks! Seeing him smile as he played with high frame rates and nice graphics brought me such joy. 	0 
What a nice thing to do. You seem to get on very well with your little bro.	0 
I love my siblings so much_comma_ they're the best.	0 
I love my brother_comma_ too. He's a great guy. How lucky we are!	1 
My older sister stole money from me.	0 
Do you know it was her for sure? That is horrible that you cant trust your own sister.	0 
Yeah_comma_ no one else in the household would ever do something like that. The worst thing is_comma_ my parents did nothing about it.	0 
That is horrible. It sucks that you have to keep such a close eye on your things in front of family. I would be so mad.	1 
Today I woke from an amazing dream which i had_comma_ it brought back a lot of amazing memories_comma_ memories which i wish i could go back to...	0 
I hear you! That sounds almost worse then a nightmare as it sounds like it's stuff you miss!	0 
Yeah_comma_ but at the same time_comma_ it motivated me for the day which was nice	0 
Thats great! What kind of stuff was in the dreams?	0 
to keep on dreaming and follow my heart_comma_ in other words_comma_ me chasing after what i love	1 
Last week as we were finishing up on a job site_comma_ the client was over joyed at the way we had done the installation. I couldn't help but keep smiling since it was my design.	0 
That has got to be one of the best feelings. I love being complimented.	0 
Yes_comma_ it is great to see something you designed be put into a working model. 	0 
You should be proud of yourself. Keep pushing it and work and it will all pay off.	1 
i was just like the usual_comma_ working on my website_comma_ and then i saw a disgusting advert which was about society	0 
Dont put too much weight into those advertisements. Sometimes they are just there to get a rise out of you.	0 
yeah_comma_ but i wish it wasn't like this	0 
I know that feeling. Sometimes they can really get under your skin.	1 
My girlfriend moved in over the weekend.  We have a ton of boxes to unpack but I am thinking it should be something that can be done in the next couple weeks.	0 
Thats nice to hear. Hopefully it makes you two happy. I would just unpack the necessities first and move from there.	0 
I think thats the plan.  After those were just slowly going to go from room to room until everything is done.  Not a huge rush and were both super happy...well I am.  I'm assuming she is too!	0 
Sounds like a plan! Make sure to hydrate properly because unpacking is cumbersome work!	1 
today i woke up_comma_ and i realised that i am more than content with my life_comma_ it made me happy and peaceful 	0 
That would be a great feeling.  Did something happen to make you feel more content?	0 
yes_comma_ i just realised i have everything i ever wanted in my life	0 
Thats so awesome! Congrats! I am hoping to get there soon.  I have a lot to be thankful for but I know I need to work on just a little bit before I am fully content.	1 
Im going to Chicago in a couple weeks.  I havent been there for about 15 years so I'm really looking forward to it.	0 
oh nice! i know that feeling_comma_ is it home? what made you think about going there?	0 
It isnt home but I went there for family trips when I was younger. My girlfriends friend is having a baby shower and lives there so I'm tagging along and were going to make a long weekend out of it!	0 
nice! hope you enjoy your weekend and make sure to make the most out of it!	1 
I really don't like randomly pumping into old friends_comma_ it get's me nervous_comma_ and i saw one of my old friend's today and  i was surprised_comma_ to say the least	0 
yeah it can be akward some times specially if you dont know what to talk about	0 
yeah_comma_ so i tried to look for a way out before i admit defeat_comma_ but then i realised there was no way out and so i talked to them in the end	0 
yeah a little chat to an old friend cannot hurt did you enjoy the conversation?	0 
yeah it wasn't bad in the end_comma_ just awkward 	0 
well im glad it did not go in the wrong direction	1 
A co-worker of mine was fired at work	0 
Do you think they deserved it?	0 
No_comma_ their performance seemed to be good	0 
Well as they say_comma_ "Better them than you"	1 
Today my wife worked super hard for our future and made an amazing progress 	0 
that is wonderful it is good to hear you guys are doing good progress	0 
thank you_comma_ in a few months everything will work out perfectly	0 
that is good hard work and determination will always pay off	1 
today i was walking outside and then suddenly had a moment where i realised how amazing my life is	0 
thats a really good feeling isnt it? anything in particular?	0 
just how i have everything i ever wanted_comma_ and that made me feel very grateful 	0 
Thats awesome.  Im glad youre happy.  keep the positive energy flowing	1 
I got accused of something at work today.	0 
Im guessing it wasnt your fault? Do you know whos it was?	0 
I wasn't even at work the day it happened_comma_ yet they still insist it was me.	0 
That sounds like sabotage to me. Is there any way to prove you werent there? I would be furious.	0 
I guess I can get them to check their logs.	1 
I watched out the window for visitors to my house today_comma_ it was saddening.	0 
Did they not ever come?	0 
No one came to visit.	0 
Man that's a bummer.  I'd visit you but that would be weird.	0 
Just a little_comma_ but I feel so lonely it might be worth it.	1 
today my wife and i decorated our house and made amazing designs on our bedroom walls_comma_ i am so proud of us 	0 
That is awesome.  What kind of designs are there?	0 
a rabbit near her and a owl near my side of the bed and random marks everywhere else	0 
That is very very cool.  I would love something like that in mine	1 
work was fun_comma_ my manager told everyone about the amazing work i put in	0 
Its always nice getting praise and compliments.  I hope everyone was proud of you	0 
they are_comma_ and i am very proud of myself	0 
Thats great.  I hope you get a raise too	1 
My dog was bit by something and had a huge front lip and looked really sad.  I felt terrible for him and was doing anything I could to help.	0 
Like what?	0 
I took him to the vet who checked it over and determined he was bit.  They suggested benedryl and rest for a couple days until it went down.	0 
Wow that's really compassionate of you	1 
I was looking though the window today and the beautiful sight outside the window gave me a positive outlook on life and made me realise to work harder for my future	0 
Are you feeling much more motivated now? What do you want to achieve?	0 
i am feeling motivated_comma_ i want to be financially free and continue to learn and develop myself even more	0 
Thats such fantastic goals to aim for in life! I wish you all the best. 	1

My brother in law stole from me and my husband I am so mad.	0 
He should be ashamed for himself_comma_ did he say why he did it?	0 
No we haven't seen him or he won't return none of the family calls he took our $500 and disappeared_comma_ 	0 
Well_comma_ on the other hand you can think of this situation_comma_ as if you just paid $500 to a person to never bother you again.	1

That's right we have to keep those in mind.	0 
I always keep some propolis pills with me just in case.	1 
Yesterday_comma_ I was in a situation where I had to stand up for myself.	0

Well there is at least one positive. Maybe you could try joining some meet up groups to help you acclimate. 	1 
Have you ever woken up like like you are ready to conquer the world today?	0 
I do almost everyday I feel like that is a great mindset to have to make your day successful.	0 
I am glad we have this in common_comma_ many people are so negative in this world.	0 
They are but to just be able to continue throughout another day is a great feeling.	1 
I love going to museums and art galleries the art and sculptures is a sight to see. 	0

Yes I do but no call backs yet wish we had a chip in her.	1 
My girlfriend's cat randomly walks over my head in the middle of my sleep.	0 
Oof_comma_ I hope that doesn't wake you up	0 
It does_comma_ and I get so upset. Apparently she doesn't ever do it to my girlfriend_comma_ only when I come over.	0 
Maybe it doesn't fell very comfortable with having you over and doesn't have any other way of expressing itself	1 
My girlfriend and I have birthdays 8 days apart.	0 
that's cool.  Do you celebrate both of them on the same day?	0 
We do! Exchanging gifts makes it feel like Christmas in the summer and it made me so happy.	0 
haha I bet.  That's pretty awesome!  	1 
So today I let my co worker draw my blood knowing she is a novice!	0 
oh no. did something bad happen?	0 
It actually went well. I felt I could give her the benefit of the doubt considering she has been doing really well recently. 	0 
That;s great. I have always been nervous no matter who drew my blood.	0 
I agree! I'_comma_m the same way_comma_ but even more since she is new_comma_ but I had confidence in her 	0 
She is going to be great at that job	0 
Yeah she is. I knew the manager done well when she hired her and this proves it. I know I can wean her from shadowing me now. 	1 
I went to call a patient back to be seen and I addressed them as Mrs and the person that walked up was a male. 	0

a tough situation but at least you were able to realize and adapt!	1 
My sister leaves her clothes all over the living room.	0 
Oh god. The living room is shared. She should just leave the messiness in her room.	0 
I agree completely! I get so irritated and I always tell her to clean up after herself_comma_ but she seems so very lackadaisical. 	0 
How old is she?	0 
She just turned 18_comma_ so there's really no excuse.	1 
My girlfriend's cat is sick with Cancer.	0 
I'm so sorry to hear that. How old is the cat?	0 
Only a couple of years old. It's so upsetting to think that she won't make it for much longer.	0 
All you can do is make sure she's not in too much pain as she goes.	1 
Last night my date decided to keep checking out the hot girl at the table next to us. 	0 
I hope you walked out right then and there!	0 
I didnt. I kept on with the date. She was very pretty and well dressed. She drove a nice care. I was kind of envious of it. 	0 
ah that was really disrespectful of her though. That's not someone you'd want to date long term.	0 
Yeah i agree. At the moment I was just envying her look. I wish I could have what she did. 	1 
The new girl at work is doing really well considering she has not experience. I'm shocked!	0 
That is good to hear. She should be a big help a lot quicker than normal then.	0 
I agree! Everyone including me were quite shocked byt it. 	0 
That should bode well for her and her future there though_comma_ so it was a good surprise!	0 
Yes it was. We all didnt think she woudl do well so fast. Took us by suprise. 	1 
After a year of being single I decided to start dating again. 	0

I was! It was very unexpected and exciting. Although_comma_ I was hoping to have time to clean the place up before he got home.	0 
How come he came home early?	1 
I took my neice to volunteer at a homeless shelter this past weekend. She showed alot of compassion and love for the homless and needy. 	0 
That's really thoughtful of you. Do you typically do things like that?	0 
Well I volunteer to help abused and battered kids. I wanted to show her things like this. I know she can be a good loving person. 	0 
Perhaps I should find the local shelter in my community and do the same. I have never done that before and I feel like I should be giving back to those less fortunate in some capacity.	0 
It makes you feel very good with yourself to be able to do things like this. I love and cherish those moments. 	1 
My boyfriend came home from his trip two days early! 	0 
Yay! Do you guys have free time to spend together now?	0 
Yes. I'm very excited since I haven't seen him in two weeks.	0

I was so upset today because 2 people decided to block traffic because of an argument. 	0 
How long did that last for?	0 
for a good 45 minutes. At that it was during rush hour. everybody was so mad at them. 	0 
Why didn't you tell them to move?	0 
We all were honking and yelling at them_comma_ but they didnt pay no mind. How inconsiderat of them. 	1 
A few years back I moved to a new state.  Now my childhood best friends and I live in different parts of the country and I don't know anyone really where I am.	0 
You must really miss them.	0 
I really do.  I mean we're in constant contact over the internet through instant messaging and video calls.  But it's not often that we all can get together and see each other in person.	0 
Yea. Seeing each other on a screen definitely can't beat being with each other in person.	0 
Definitely.  We've talked about making plans to visit each other but it's hard to find the time to organize it.	1 
My boyfriend unexpectedly came home from his trip two days early!	0 
did he catch you doing something crazy?	0 
No_comma_ thankfully I was just eating. 	0 
Thats good lol	1

I am so sorry for you. Perhaps you can hang with her after your workdays?	0 
Yeah maybe we can do that. Its not the same though. 	1 
I cant wait for Friday! I go on vacation to New York!	0

I agree. Ill do my best not too. I feel horrible eating a whole pizza. I will pay for it tomorrow. 	1 
I remember when my friends were helping me move out of our hometown.  We were riding in the moving truck and it came time to drop them off and say goodbye.  We all felt terrible.	0 
I would feel terrible too. Where did you move to?	0 
I moved to a town about 30-45 minutes away_comma_ but at that point we were so used to seeing each other every day of our lives.  It was hard to get used to.	0 
I've moved almost half a dozen times in my life before_comma_ so I completely understand. Those were rough times.	0 
Yeah_comma_ it's always a big hassle having to pick up and go like that.  There's so much to take care of and do before you make the actual move.	1 
The manager the store was very mean and rude to the employees. I could not beleive it. 	0 
That sucks_comma_ imagine being in an environment like that all day_comma_ I would go crazy	0 
I agree. It made me sick to my stomach seeing it. I feel bad for them!	0 
I guess some people are just really rude_comma_ no matter what position you put them in	0 
Yeah. It makes me wanna puke thinking about how mean he was!	1 
Last night my GPS asked me to make a right down a dark and scary road. 	0 
It's hard to trust a GPS. I have heard a lot of stories about people being steered the wrong way. Please tell me you didn't do it.	0 
I was very nervous and doubting to do it. I actually did and it wasnt that bad	0 
I am so glad that it didn't turn out bad for you. 	0 
Me too. At first I wasnt going to_comma_ but I didnt want to get lost. 	1 
I finally told my friend I was into him. He didnt take it too well. 	0 
what did he do _comma_ how did he react ?	0 
He rejected me and told me not to every call him again. Im so embarrassed. I should have known better. 	0 
Well he is the one missing out and  i'm sure your very worthy of attention from some better.	0 
Maybe. I just feel bad and embarrassed about it. I should known better not to mess up our friendship. 	1 
Last night my neice placed 5th at her dance performance. She was so upset and so was I	0 
Why was she upset? Depending on how many people entered_comma_ fifth could be really good.	0 
There were 30 girls. We worked very hard and felt she would place top 3 but what an outcome it was to be 5th. 	0 
That's still really good! She did better than 25 other people. 	0 
I agree.Im proud of her_comma_ but she was very upset at the judges. 	1 
I am very excited to not have any plans this weekend. It's going to be so nice to relax for two whole days.	0 
NIce! I bet you cant wait! Do you anticipate to releax or do things to catch up?	0 
Just relaxing this weekend. 	0 
Very nice! I bet its going to be a good happy weekend. 	1 
My best friend has won those Taco Bell Playstation 4 giveaways twice so far.  I wish I could be that lucky sometimes.	0 
Dang_comma_ and here I thought I was lucky winning a free soft drink in that contest. Maybe we have to pool our efforts together and try to win us something big?	0 
I know_comma_ man just got together and buy like 50 boxes and cross our fingers.  And another thing was he got it on his first try both times.	0 
Why stop at 50? We ought to get 100! We need to show your friend and evil corporate Taco Bell who is boss and nab us some consoles!	0 
Haha_comma_ that's the spirit!  Win us some systems_comma_ sell them off and use the money to buy more boxes.	1 
My nephew asked me to use my car this weekend for a drivers ed class. 	0 
Did you let him?	0 
We have been practicing together in my car _comma_ so I feel I can let him. 	0 
You are good to allow him to borrow the car.	0 
Yeah. I feel he wont let me down. 	1 
Im planning on going sky diving this weekend! 	0

I dont think I will ever not be scared of heights. The thought of it makes me have the chills!	1 
My roommate leaves leftovers in the fridge and they get moldy.	0 
That sounds revolting! Have you said anything to him about it?	0 
No. I'm not very confrontational. And our lease is up in two months anyway so I'm just going to wait it out.	0 
That sounds like a good plan. Perhaps you should request a formal resume from any potential roommates for your future abode.	1 
I was at the library today and was trying to study_comma_ but this lady across the table was smacking her gum very loud. 	0 
Did you ask her to stop it or did you have to move away from her?	0 
well the library is very small so limited seats so I had to sit there and listen to it. I was so frusterated	0 
That was very rude of her to do that_comma_ some people just have no manners.	0 
Yah I agree. I could understand if it was not so quiet and an open place. I can still hear it in my ear now!	1 
So this weekend Im going to do a marathon. I have worked very hard to get myself ready for it	0 
That's so exciting! Have you run a marathon before?	0 
I never have. I think all this time I been practicing will pay off.	0 
That's good_comma_ I hope you do well! How did you prepare?	0 
I joined cross fit and did alot of cardio work outs.I think this helped me for it.	1 
My boyfriend came home from his trip two days early! 	0 
What a nice surprise! Did something happen or did he miss you!?	0 
His business trip wrapped up a few days earlier than planned.	0 
I see.I bet you and him are happy to be able to spend a little time together. 	1 
I doubt I will get any sleep waiting for tomorrow.	0 
I'm sorry to hear. Why is that?	0 
I am finally getting to take the kids to Disneyland! 	0 
Oh_comma_ well that is a fine thing indeed! I would be  jumping up and down!	1 
 I had to go out of town by myself for three weeks. It was hard not being able to talk to anyone I knew. 	0 
Sounds pretty lonely. Did you meet or make some friends while out of town?	0 
No_comma_ I was too busy focusing on work while I was there.	0 
Ah I see. Staying focused is hard_comma_ especially when your lonely.	1 
My neice didnt get into nursing school.She worked so hard for this. I feel bad for her.	0 
That's horrible! Is she going to try again?	0 
Yeah she is. She is going to retake some classes she made a B in. The look on her face after she found out was pricelss.	0 
It must have been awful to see that in someone you care about. I'm glad she's not giving up.	0 
yeah thats what i said. Its like the world ended when she found out_comma_ but she is doing better now.	1 
I cant wait for this weekend! Im leaving for New York!	0

Nice! Were they scratch offs?	0 
For the powerball. We are all crossing our fingers!	0 
I will cross mine too! I hope ya'll win it big.	0 
WE hope we do to!	1 
Last night while driving home I fell asleep at the wheel. 	0 
OMG....that had to be so scary.	0 
Yes it was. My phone rang and thats what woke me up. Im so lucky to be here today. 	0 
I am so glad that you are. Now no more driving when your sleepy.	0 
Yeah im very thankful I didnt crash last night. 	1 
My upstairs neighbors make a ton of noise at all hours of the night. It makes it difficult for me to sleep. 	0 
That really sucks. Maybe you should try egging their door? Or just break in and pretend you're bigfoot while they're trying to sleep.	0 
I'm not trying to get arrested! I think I'll just wait things out until I move in two months.	0 
I would go with the bigfoot option. You can get a costume on the cheap on ebay nowadays. I've used that tactic countless times and it has never failed!	1 
Im expecting a good bonus to be on this check coming up. I can finally go buy a new car!	0 
That is some exciting news. Do you already know what kind of vehicle you want?	0 
Yes! Very exciting! Yes I had my eye on one all year. I cant wait	0

Whats kind of exam is that?	0 
Statistics exam. I aced this class for sure. There's no doubt in my mind. 	1 
I've got a big test coming up and I'm so worried!	0 
Don't be. i think you will ace it.	0 
I hope so. I usually do better than I expect to_comma_ but that still doesn't make it any less scary.	0 
exam's are always scary. we just need to take the mind out of it	1 
My bank has called me three times a day ever since I applied for a mortgage. It's been a week and they show no signs of slowing down. 	0 
Why not block the calls?	0 
I want them to be able to get in touch with me if something important comes up.	0 
Have you asked them to stop calling about this topic?	1 
My upstairs neighbors make a ton of noise at all hours of the night. It makes it difficult for me to sleep.	0 
Have you spoken to him?	0 
No_comma_ I don't like to be confrontational. I'm moving in two months anyway_comma_ so I'm just going to wait it out.	0 
Maybe you should buy some earplugs.	1 
I watched Wimbledon on TV over the summer for the first time. Those tennis players are so good!	0 
I love tennis. Will you watch the US Open?	0 
Maybe. I hadn't considered it yet.	0 
It is a great tournament_comma_ you should watch.	1 
My bank has called me three times a day ever since I applied for a mortgage. It's been a week and they show no signs of slowing down.	0 
So are they telling you good news?	0 
Not yet. I just filled out the prequalification online. I haven't officially applied yet.	0 
Oh okay. Well hopefully they give you a chance to breathe and decide what you want to do.	1 
My mom said she was going to make me a mystery dinner. I believe in her!	0 
Ooh how nice! Do you have any guesses as to what she may be making you?	0 
Nope! She was going to make something completely different from what she usually makes!	0 
Well I hope it's good! Your mom sounds like a great person to have a fun surprise for you like that.	1 
I met my wife online 7 years ago and can't see myself with anyone else_comma_ ever.	0 
You are so lucky to find someone special online. That can turn out so badly sometimes for some people. 	0 
Oh I know. I got lucky_comma_ we found out we lived really close to each other so we met up and it has been great ever since.	0 
That sounds like fate? Being that both of you lived close to each other.	1 
My daughter has worked very hard to keep her school work finished_comma_ her room clean_comma_ and the dishes washed. I bought her a cell phone for her birthday this year. She is becoming a responsible young preteen	0 
Wow_comma_ watching kids grow up is hard. How has she been with the cell phone?	0 
She has been good so far. We are trying to limit her access to it to just a few hours per day. She also had to "turn it in" at night before she goes to bed.	0 
That's great parenting! You have to trust that your children will make the right choices.	0 
Yes_comma_ you do! Hopefully she keeps doing the right thing with it	0 
I am sure with your guidance she will!	1 
I have been having some anxiety lately and made an appointment with a psychiatrist. I kept going back and forth about if I wanted to actually go	0 
You should go_comma_ Otherwise the condition could get worse.	0 
I ended up going. I'm really glad I did. She has been a HUGE help for me.	0 
That is great news! fortunately doctors are there to help us and i'm glad they have helped you!	1 
I had a septic tank issue and called a guy that I found a business card from and had him come out. He didn't have hardly any equipment with him and sounded like he didn't know what to do.	0 
Oh my goodness that sounds so bad! Did they charge you for the visit?	0 
No. I just asked what it would cost to fix then told him I couldn't afford it to get him to leave. 	0 
You made the right move. They at least have to show up with that giant truck that sucks the tank dry.	1 
I bought a big bag of M&Ms and I could not resist it	0 
If I had a bag of M&M's right now I would eat them for sure!	0 
well that is what I just did_comma_ so far I have eaten half of it	0 
maybe save the other half for later. lol.	0 
I do not think I can and feel ashamed that I cannot resist it	0 
That's ok_comma_ it happens to us all. Tomorrow is a new day.	1 
I told my girlfriend about my self harm habits a little while ago.	0 
How did she reacted to the admission to self harm? 	0 
She was really sad_comma_ but she appreciated the fact that I told her. 	0 
Now that your girlfriend knows the problem_comma_  the both of you can work on solutions and support together.	1 
My friends wanted to bring me to laser quest for my birthday.	0 
Is that like a laser tag place? That sounds like a lot of fun! What do you think?	0 
Yeah exactly. I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not and I was a little unwilling to try it out. 	0 
I've played laser tag a few times. I think you will have a great time! It's very high paced and noisy but that's half the fun.	1 
I spent all of summer doing everything but studying for my final exam	0 
Oh that sounds worrisome_comma_ do you think you will pass?	0 
I'm fairly certain I'm going to fail and I feel awful about myself_comma_ but I just can't get myself to do it.	0 
I'm sad to hear that but human nature is hard to fight. Honestly_comma_ if you have any alternative options or plans you may have to fall back on them.	1 
My friends and I had spent all day troubleshooting a new PC build that we had just completed.	0 
That sounds intensive! How did it go?	0 
It went awful. It turned out that the motherboard or processor were defective and we had to deconstruct it to return both pieces. So much wasted time!	0 
I bet that was so defeating! I'm sorry to hear that. I wish there was better quality control with some of these companies that deal in parts.	0 
It really was. At least my friend learned a lot about computers as we built it together!	0 
That's a good bright side to look at.	1 
I found an injured spider with a leg missing in my bathroom a few days ago.	0 
Did you save it or kill it?	0 
I saved it. I brought it outside and hoped for the best.	0 
It's missing a leg so its probably dead unfortunately.	1 
I passed two trials that a company put me through and I only have three left.	0 
ooh_comma_ I bet you can't wait to finish!	0 
You got that right! I'm feeling pretty happy about my performance and I think I'll get the job!	0 
I hope you get it! Good luck!	1 
I spent hours studying for a final exam.	0 
How did they go? Did you pass?	0 
It went amazing! I expected to pass but I didn't think I'd get a 91!	0 
Wow! congrats_comma_ you should totally be proud of yourself.	1 
I found an old stamp booklet my girlfriend and I filled out before we started dating.	0 
That's very sweet! I bet it brought up a lot of feelings inside you.	0 
 Definitely. I felt so warm and fuzzy on the inside_comma_ and so did she when I sent her a snapchat of it.	0 
You guys sound like you have a solid relationship. It's always great to find those little pieces from the early days.	1 
I'm pretty sure a girl at the convention was hitting on me.	0 
Did you get her number?	0 
Nah. I have a loving girlfriend and I would never cheat on her.	0 
Good man_comma_ I have a lot of respect for that.	1 
For my camping trip_comma_ I brought with me my tent_comma_ camping chairs_comma_ mattress_comma_ sleeping bag_comma_ pillows_comma_ med-kit_comma_ bug spray_comma_ food and beer.	0 
That sounds like quite the checklist. I'm glad you brought the beer you might need it haha!	0 
Oh yeah definitely. Never have I ever felt so ready for anything in my life.	0 
Well I bet you're going to have a great time. With that haul I don't see how you couldn't!	1 
I saw a man slap his dog on the sidewalk a few times while I was on the bus.	0 
Holy cow! Did you call him in?	0 
I should have_comma_ but last time my girlfriend did that the police ignored it. I was so angry.	0 
Oh man!  Do you have a dog?	0 
I do_comma_ and I couldn't fathom how someone could do that. I wanted to hop off the bus and yell at the guy.	1 
I just had to replace one of the window panes in my house.	0 
How come? And was it a pain to replace it?	0 
I'm not sure what happened.  I had to have a guy come out to replace it_comma_ and couldn't meet him_comma_ so my wife had to.	0 
I hope he did a good job!	0 
My said he did!  I had quite a bit of confidence in him_comma_ based on others' feedback.	0 
Awesome_comma_ I'm glad to hear that. Sometimes it's hard to find contractors with good reputation.	1 
When I was a kid_comma_ all my friends had Yu-Gi-Oh cards but me.	0 
How come you didn't collect them? i loved them myself.	0 
I think my parents found them expensive_comma_ otherwise I can't think of any other good reason. To be honest_comma_ I kind of envied my friends.	0 
Well_comma_ they are expensive and you didn't really miss much.	0 
In that case_comma_ I feel much better haha.	1 
I took up running and I started seeing a huge improvement in my cardiovascular endurance.	0 
Nice_comma_ Was it hard to start?	0 
Unimaginably hard. But once I got into it I couldn't stop. I'm feeling pretty certain that I'll hit my 5km goal in no time.	0 
Wish i could run close to 5km_comma_ i'd struggle with 100 meters.	0 
I used to be that guy too. If I can do it_comma_ you can do it.	1 
My younger brother was playing an old Gamecube game that I loved to play back when I was a kid.	0 
That's cool. Man_comma_ those tiny disks were easy to lose. what game?	0 
He was playing Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door. What an awesome game! It brought back so many great memories.	0 
That's awesome. I get nostalgic about old games as well. 	1 
My buddy drank way too much at a party and puked all over my favorite jacket.	0 
That sounds horrible_comma_ Did you wash it or throw it away?	0 
I washed it and it came out surprisingly. But at that time_comma_ I felt so sick seeing what was happening to my jacket that I thought I was going to puke next.	0 
That is a really rough story_comma_ You should make him pay for another one.	1 
A few months ago_comma_ a good friend of mine that I look up to attempted suicide.	0 
damn_comma_ is he ok now?	0 
Thankfully he is. He's doing much better_comma_ but the thought still shakes me scared to this day.	0 
Did he go to the doctors for help? anyway i'm glad he is OK.	0 
Yeah he did. He's on meds and he sees a therapist every week!	1 
I drank too much and passed out a few months ago. 	0 
Oh no! Was it a fun night? 	0 
It was_comma_ but it got scary at some point. Apparently people were trying to wake me up by shaking me and I would not get up.	0 
Oh heck! That had to be really scary for them! glad you're okay though! 	1 
I was packing up my house to move_comma_ and found my old yearbooks! It's so weird to look back and see how far everyone I knew in high school has come.	0 
Aww_comma_ that sounds interesting!  Are you in touch with many people from high school?	0 
A couple people. Fewer as the years go by_comma_ unfortunately. 	0 
I get that.  It's weird when I forget the name of someone I knew for years.	1 
My brother went on a low-calorie diet and began shaking everyday.	0 
Poor thing!  Is he felling better now?  I hope he quit that diet.	0 
He quit the diet a while ago as recommended by his doctor. I was a little scared but I knew it was just side effects of a bad diet.	0 
Thank god he is ok.  There are very dangerous diets around_comma_ better be guided by his doctor.	1 
I let my brother drive my car for the first time yesterday.	0 
Were you nervous?	0 
No_comma_ he's such a good driver. I knew I had nothing to worry about.	0 
That's awesome.  I'm glad he did so well.	1 
Last week I woke up to a really cute text from my girlfriend and a funny message from my brother.	0 
That's lovely! I love waking up to awesome texts.	0 
Yeah! I had a moment of realizing how lucky I am to be in the position I find myself in_comma_ and felt really thankful for my life and the people a part of it.	0 
That's so wonderful to hear.	1 
My girlfriend spent a few days in the woods with no cellular service with her parents.	0 
How did that make you feel?	0 
Really lonesome. I missed her so much.	0 
I bet. I'm not great at being away from my boyfriend.	1 
Ever since I've been on these anti anxiety and depression medication_comma_ I've been able to socialize a lot more.	0 
That's great! What have you been doing to socialize?	0 
Just talking to more people in general. For example_comma_ at a convention I was volunteering at. 	0 
What kind of convention?	0 
It's called Otakuthon. It celebrates Japanese culture_comma_ anime and videogames. I was with MSI and I was just so surprised with my improvement.	1 
I volunteer at a dog shelter every weekend.	0 
That's such a sweet thing to do.	0 
Thank you_comma_ they're so cute!	0 
Dogs are probably my favorite pet. Maybe I should take up volunteering for a dog shelter one day.	1

Lil Peep died? when.	0 
November of 2017. Almost a year ago. 	0 
damn_comma_ him and XXXtentacion we're really good.	0 
Never really listened to XXX but Peep's music really resonated with me.	1 
My dog sheds so much I have to vacuum my room practically every 4 days if I don't want little tufts of fur everywhere.	0 
I love puppies! But they definitely are a lot of work in terms of their hair.	0 
You're right. I'm just so irritated_comma_ even if it isn't his fault and I love the big goof.	0 
I understand. Our puppy sheds a ton too and he isnt even that hairy of a dog	1 
My brother and a bunch of our friends planned to go to a 15-person cottage in July.	0 
Oh my_comma_ that sounds like an absolute blast!	0 
It was. At that time_comma_ I couldn't wait for all the fun and games we would experience!	0 
Did you stay for long? That would be a great vacation. 	0 
We stayed for only 4 days because it cost us about $200 each for four days and nights_comma_ but I hope we can book it for a whole week or two next summer.	0 
What a great time! Is the cottage on a lake?	0 
It's very close to a lake_comma_ it probably takes a two minute hike down through a patch of trees and tall grass to get there.	0 
Sounds like heaven!	1 
One time when I was in Kindergarten_comma_ I needed to go to the restroom. The teacher did not let me_comma_ so I peed myself	0

Yes_comma_ they called my parents and I was sent home. I got spanked	0 
Aww_comma_ I'm sorry. Hope that teacher learned a lesson 	1

It's wonderful peace of mind to find someone you can trust with your fur babies! Did you have a nice trip?	0 
Yes_comma_ I was able to go visit my stepdaughter on the other side of the country. The sitter sent pictures occasionally_comma_ so I didn't spend my trip worrying.	0 
Aw_comma_ that was so nice! I'd love to find a cat sitter like that!	1 
My son had his 4th birthday a couple of weeks ago.	0 
How did it go? What'd you get him for a gift?	0 
He got a remote control excavator_comma_ and had a lot of fun at his party.  It's crazy how fast he's growing up_comma_ though.	0 
It seems like all those years just flew by_comma_ huh. At least now he's getting old enough to start remembering all these great times!	1 
It's really hard to get motivated on Fridays.	0 
Are you feeling zapped from the week?	0 
Yeah_comma_ there's a lot going on.  I ended up heading to work anyway.	0 
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you don't have to work through the weekend!	0 
No_comma_ I don't have to.  But there's plenty of work to do on our house!	0 
It never ends does it? I hope you keep your head above water though_comma_ it's all you got sometimes!	1 
I bought a bunch of dumbbells_comma_ and a workout bench but I've barely used them.	0 
I feel that pain. Do you not have the motivation or just dont know what to do?	0 
I don't have the motivation. I know the workouts I should be doing but also struggle with proper form a bit.	0 
I get that. Well if I could give any advice it would be make sure you have proper form over anything. Dont worry about heavy weight if your form is garbage.	0 
Thanks for the advice!	0 
Sure. I love working out. 	1

Did you get wrote up or a lecture when you got their.	0 
Well I will find out tomorrow. I know better than that is what she told me_comma_ especially on Fridays_comma_ when we are the busiest. 	0 
Its always best to be on time _comma_ I hope they understand no one is perfect.	0 
I agree. I feel so bad and embarrassed about it. Even the doctor scolded me. 	1 
My boss told me to go to school to become a doctor instead of a nurse. I felt like it was a compliment. Im worried about how much and how long medical school will take.	0 
The journey there is always the toughest_comma_ its years of practice and studying but in the end it will be totally worth it	0 
I agree. I guess I will weigh my options_comma_ its just im getting old and watn to start a family too_comma_ so I dont know.	0 
With whatever you decide in life just know that you are a very skilled and intelligent person! Im sure you will find your path in life eventually with time	0 
Thank you for that! You just made my day!	1 
My friend and I got in an argument about religion today. It made me question my faith. 	0 
Wow_comma_  that was serious then	0 
Yeah. I want to stay true to my beliefs_comma_ but she made some very valid points. 	0 
OK_comma_  so what is your plan now? 	0 
I will do research about her theories and then make really think about sticking to my beliefs. 	1 
I remember back when I started college. I moved to a new state where I didn't know anyone and I had no idea what to expect.	0 
Wow that sounds scary. Did you make good friends?	0 
Yes_comma_ I did eventually. There's something to be said for living in a dorm at a time when you want to meet new people and fit in.	0 
Yes it can be really helpful! I went to school 3 hours from my home and it was still hard to meet new people	1 
Today I had to tell a patient about her lab results. Come to find out she could not have babies. She was very upset.	0 
Oh_comma_ that must have been a hard thing to do. I'd hate to be the one to deliver such a bad news...	0 
Yeah I felt bad. She started crying so much. Its like her world ended there.	0 
So sad...that makes me want to cry_comma_ too_comma_ just hearing about her reaction.	1 
Whenever I go back to my hometown I love driving by the house I grew up in. I have such great memories.	0 
I bet it does! Do you go by there often?	0 
I get to visit about once a year. I always wish that I knew who lived there now so I could see the inside of the house.	0 
I bet it's much different than it was back when you lived there.	0 
A little_comma_ but mostly I love seeing all the things that are the same.	1 
I found out some bad news the other day.	0 
Oh no :( Can you tell me? It's okay if it's too private.	0 
I just got back my grade for my final for my class and I failed it. I studied real hard_comma_ but unfortunately it didn't seem to matter.	0 
Oh my gosh I'm so sorry that really sucks. :( Can you talk to the professor and try to make it up or find out what you did wrong?	0 
I'm going to have to at least try. Maybe they'll be understanding and let me attempt again.	0 
Good luck to you! I wish you all the best <3	1 
Someone twisted what I Said earlier today to make it seem like i was saying something else. I felt reall ybad.	0 
Oh no why would they do such a thing	0 
They were angry and wanted to be aggressive. 	0 
Definitely doesn't excuse what they did.	1 
Some lady I know tried to hit on me even though she very well knew I am in a relationship!	0 
That's not cool. I bet it felt awkward.	0 
It really did but I would never do something to jeopardize my relationship.	0 
You are a stand up person!	1 
I had a nice quiet evening at home tonight.	0 
Nice_comma_ silence is golden	0 
Well_comma_ my family was here_comma_ too.  Toddlers don't make life quiet_comma_ but they make me feel fulfilled.	0 
Full of what?	0 
Full of meaning.	1 
There was a meeting scheduled today that I thought was utterly pointless.	0 
Oh no_comma_ was it one of those meetings that should have been an email?	0 
It definitely was_comma_ so I ended up skipping it.	0 
Hopefully you don't get in trouble but I definitely know the feeling. 	0 
I regretted skipping the meeting a little bit_comma_ but probably not as much as if I'd gone to it.	1 
I told my close friend a very big secret yesterday.	0 
Oh really_comma_ were you supposed to tell them?	0 
It was my choice. I really don't think they'll tell anyone! They're good people.	0 
You can never be to sure now a days_comma_ they might post your secret to social media.	1 
One time I was really sure that I was going to ace a test because I studied all night	0 
Did you ace your test?	0 
Yup_comma_ I was worried during the test too_comma_ but I am glad everything turned out okay	0 
I always worry when I have to take tests. Unfortunately_comma_ I am horrible with tests. I am glad you aced it!	1 
A friend at work recently got a raise.  That's the 2nd one in the last year for him!	0 
Nice_comma_ what a legend and a gentleman	0 
Yeah_comma_ but I haven't had one in 3 years.	0 
Word_comma_ you should ask him what the secret is	1 
I was totally committed to him in every way I could be.   HOwever he ended up cheating on me	0 
That kind of cold disregard for someone you're supposed to love is totally alien to me_comma_ the guilt would destroy me.	0 
It would me too_comma_ not only that but he just up and got with her like I never existed to him.   Its funny because he always accused me of cheating on him and I had no clue why.  It was him the whole time!	0 
Yeah Freud called it Projection_comma_ it's too bad people tend to hide their true natures so well.	1 
He kept doing drugs_comma_ and taking things that didnt belong to him.  It broke my heart but I didnt know what else to do.	0 
It's awful! I know so many families are dealing with similar situation. Sometimes we don't know how to help someone close to us. Heart breaking...	0 
Yes you are right about that.  I dealt with it for a long time and then I just couldn't anymore.  Over and over things would disappear and he would of course always deny it.  He became violent at time to his sister and me and I couldn't put them at risk.	0 
You can't help him until he wants to really change. Sometimes all you can do is pray.	1 
today after coming back from work i saw my wife and she was asking me why are you late with questioning eyes_comma_ i told her that i wen't to go and get her favourite meal_comma_ i felt so faithful 	0 
Did she feel bad and apologize after she realized what you had done?	0 
she was joking about it_comma_ but she was so happy afterwards and we ate together_comma_ it was such a nice day	0 
It's good to get to spend time with those you love. I am happy for you.	1 
after a long day from work_comma_ i was stuck at this math problem_comma_ but then i decided to go for a walk instead of working on the problem_comma_ i trust my guts_comma_ after i had come back from the walk_comma_ the solution kicked in and i was able to do the problem	0 
That's inspiring_comma_ has that worked for you in the past in the same way?	0 
yes always_comma_ it is something that works for me	0 
That's so cool_comma_ you seem very intuitive	1 
it was 3am_comma_ i was walking at the utter night... i was scared out of my mind... anything could happen_comma_ my walking speed increased... and everything i was seeing suddenly became more and more scary	0 
That sounds frightening. Did you get home safely?	0 
in the end yes.. but the journey was sure hell	0 
Why were you walking so late at night?	1 
today i realised the small details of my life and i feel more satisfied	0 
Nice_comma_ what are some things you realized?	0 
that i have everything i wished for.	0 
You don't have me yet <3	1 
One time I bought water and snacks before a hurricane came to wreck my city	0 
oh god_comma_ how did you . have the courage to even go outside?	0 
My house flooded so I had to get on my roof !	0 
that sounds like an adventurous day 	1 
One time they put cheese in my hamburger when I told them not to!	0 
Wow_comma_ how could they do that?	0 
They are complete monsters I tell ya!	0 
Someone's gotta put an end to that poor service!	1 
i lied to my mother and i feel very uneasy	0 
You should. No matter what you can't lie to your Mom. It will always come back on you.	0 
i just realised this now	0 
Come clean and fix it. It will make you feel better.	1 
i am beginning to realise in my abilities and i feel so confident in them_comma_ i am able to anything	0 
Nice! Do you have any superpowers?	0 
In a way yes_comma_yes i do the power of my will and mind	0 
I like your confidence! Fighting!	1 
When I drink coffee_comma_ memories from my past keep playing in my head	0 
oh nice_comma_ what kind of memories?	0 
Memories of talking to strangers in chatroom. Lots of things 	0 
how does this make you feel like?	1 
I have been working on my programming skills and I feel like I can get a new job now!	0 
That's awesome! You're going to be rolling in the dough with those skills	0 
Hell yeah_comma_ no more living in mom's basement!	0 
That's exciting. How long have you been learning programming?	1 
From time to time I see an older man around our town driving his lawn mower from place to place..  SOmetimes I see him at  McDonalds_comma_or the Dollar General Store.  	0 
an interesting one_comma_ what does this make you feel ?	0 
Well at first I thought it was cute until I saw him at the gas station the other day.  I overheard him asking someone that was getting gas if he happened to have a little change he could have.  He needed to get home in his lawnmower but didn't have the money to do so.   I ended up giving him 3 bucks.	0 
oh did he say anything afterwards? what happend next?	1 
i believe i am a really caring person_comma_ because i always take care of cats and feed them and lately they are more and more close to me	0 
That is so kind of you_comma_ I also a have a soft heart for animals.  I happen to be a dog person_comma_ but I do have a cat that was my ex boyfriends.  	0 
i am a both person ahaha i also have a dog_comma_ but he is always so mean 	0 
I can't say I have had any mean dogs as of yet.  My favorite breed is  a pitbull.   THey are so loyal  and sweet although  lots of people claim they are mean and vicious .	1 
towels_comma_ clothes_comma_ underwear and phone all checked! and ready for my holiday #feelingsoprepeared	0 
where are you going!	0 
TO SEE MY BABY GIRL	0 
thats awesome i hope you have a good time with her	1 
One time I bought a scratch lottery ticket and I didn't win anything!	0 
Wow_comma_ that must've been disappointing.	0 
Yes_comma_ I was off by one number. I was going to be a millionaire!	0 
Oh! So close. Just to think about that missed opportunity.	1 
every day the weather makes me feel so nostalgic_comma_ the colors_comma_ the wind all bring back a certain memory from my past	0 
Yeah_comma_ it's like time passes but the smells and everything stays the same	0 
yes! i am so glad you get it_comma_ it's beautiful but also sad at the same time	0 
Yup_comma_ and I feel there's a part of us that is eternal as well	1 
One time I went into the public restroom and saw poop smeared everywhere! Ew!	0 
I think I would leave if I saw something like that.	0 
I left as fast as possible!	0 
Did you tell someone about it so they could take care of it?	0 
Nope_comma_ just you!	0 
It seems most responsible to alert someone to clean it.	1 
One time I was so nervous to look at my grade for my final exam	0 
I feel that way sometimes when I check my bank account_comma_ how's school going?	0 
I failed and dropped out! Now I live in my parents house doing nothing all day	0 
Word_comma_ college is tough_comma_ wishing you the best	1 
like who on earth writes var int value = 1_comma_ this is so ridiculous i am so annoyed at my brother_comma_ after everything i tought him_comma_ he doesn't even know the basics 	0 
 and got upset with you?	0 
no i was the one who was upset with him	0 
 And why do not you try to teach your brother?	0 
PROGRAMMING!	1 
i am working so hard_comma_ that i can see a pile of money building up for my future 	0 
Good for you!  I hope it does not stress you out_comma_ though.	0 
it doesn't i am taking regular breaks	0 
That is good.  Money is no good if you are not healthy enough to enjoy it.	1 
One time I saw a creepy person run towards me in the night out in the streets	0 
Dang_comma_ how fast did you run away?	0 
I froze up because I was terrified. It was just my brother though	0 
Did you tell him how creepy he is lol	1 
While I was packing my stuff to move_comma_ I found Old high school pictures. It made me think of all the good times  I had.	0 
That is awesome_comma_ what types of photos did you find? Anything funny or silly? 	0 
Well more of my old best friend. I have not seen her i a long time.We went through alot together. It was nostalgic to me. 	0 
Aww yeah_comma_ those are great times that you can never really go back to. Sometimes I also wish I could go back in time...maybe you could call her up again and catch up on the last few years! 	0 
I agree! We have alot of things to catch up on. 	1 
being alive is so much stress and anxiety_comma_ why does it have to be like this? why can't we just all express our individual selves_comma_ instead we are forced to work so that we can eat 	0 
It's not fair_comma_ eh. Having to suppress those feelings day in and day out is significantly harder than the mundane work itself. At least it's comforting know that most everyone feels the same? 	0 
Yes_comma_ it's true we all know this inside out_comma_ but we still continue to work on our meaningless lives_comma_ the funny thing is we all know but no one is acting_comma_ if we all acted we would be living in a much more beautiful and free life_comma_ not one which just gives the impression of freedom_comma_ that's all there is now_comma_ faking but i guess the one thing that is true is my feelings	0 
Maybe if we weren't so attached to being creatures of comfort. Some things we just can't let go of_comma_ wouldn't exist without some poor shmuck having to do the dirty work. I guess we're all that shmuck to someone_comma_ someway or another.	1 
I watched a movie the other night that really got me in my feelings.	0 
Oh wow_comma_ what ovie was it and how did it make you feel? 	0 
I don't remember the name. I was watching it with a friend and they put it on but it was about a son who found his birth mother after many years apart.	0 
oh wow that sounds very emotional_comma_ I think I would have needed a bucket to catch all my tears. 	1 
i am so disappointed in myself_comma_ i could have do so much better at work but i guess it wasn't my day_comma_ i was not able to focus	0 
I liked my friend very much and believed that he can not talk negatively about me	0 
what makes you so sure? anything can happen i mean just look at murphy's law 	0 
May be you are right. But sometimes_comma_ you go with your heart not with the law. Murphy's law may not work in every situation.	1 
My grandma ended up getting really sick this last week.	0 
Oh no_comma_ I am sorry to hear that. How is she doing and how are you holding up? 	0 
She is getting much better. My family and I did everything we could to take care of her.	0 
That is great that she has such a great support group and loving family members to support her. I hope she gets well soon! :)	1 
i feel so guilty_comma_ my sister crying because 'someone eat her cake' that she had been saving for 2 days now_comma_ and that someone was non other than me...	0 
Oh no_comma_ maybe buy her a new cake to make it up to her!	0 
oh wow you are such a genius! why didn't i think of that before... there is always a bright side to everything	0 
Yes there is! Maybe throw in a cupcake too_comma_ I am sure she will forgive you in a heart beat! I know I would. :) 	1 
words cannot describe how happy i am_comma_ in 2 weeks time i will go and see my wife i am so joyful and exciting 	0 
I am so happy for you! Why have you been apart for the past two weeks?	0 
no we live in a long distance relationship (not for long though) so it's hard for me to see her_comma_ but i will be able to see her after 6 months apart  	0 
Awesome to hear that you'll get to live with your loved one soon	1 
I had a terrible experience at the grocery store today.	0 
Oh no what happened_comma_ are you alright? 	0 
Yeah_comma_ I'm alright. But I dropped a jar of pasta sauce and it ended up shattering. Sauce got all over the floor.	0 
Oh no that must have been a terrible experience_comma_ I hope no one got hurt from the shattered glass.	1 
I aced all my classes this semester_comma_ so Im hoping and thinking my GPA will be a 4.0	0 
That's what I like to hear! What changes did you make this semester to achieve your possible 4.0?	0 
I actually gave more effort this semester_comma_ so I will continue to do goo and hope to get into nursing school next year.	0 
wow. that's awesome! you'll need  that work ethic in nursing school for sure.	0 
I agree. Im planning and hopping things go well.	1 
So everything for a party im throwing this weekend is ready and everything is paid for. I have it ready last week so I wouldnt stress.	0 
It sounds like you're quite the organized person!	0 
Yea. I like to have things ready and done prior to make sure everything goes well.	0 
I'm the same way a lot of the time. It's really a good way to avoid any unnecessary disasters.	1 
Im going to ask my girlfriend to marry me this weekend! I have no doubt in my mind she will say no	0 
That is so exciting! Best of luck to you man! I doubt she would reject such a great guy like you. :) 	0 
Thanks! I think we are doing well so i wont be disappointed or sidetracked by a no from her.	0 
That is great_comma_ I would also be surprised if she said no to a man like you! 	1 
i am so afraid... afraid that i am not giving too much to the world_comma_ what if i parish not having done anything?	0 
I wouldn't worry too much about it. None of it really matters_comma_ if we make a difference or not_comma_ we all end up dust in the end.	0 
no_comma_ i don't believe that_comma_ whether you are having a bad day or not if you look at everything clearly you will see there is a next stage_comma_ just like birth death is a process	0 
If telling yourself that makes you feel better_comma_ I found all of that to be much more stressful. To be completely honest with you I think people invented stories about the after life to make them more comfortable with death.	0 
Not necessarily_comma_  while it's true you have your traditional christian or Muslim that preach the afterlife as some miracle and hell_comma_ scaring people into not being themselves_comma_ but death isn't a scary phase_comma_ and i don't care about whether i am going to die_comma_ as that is just the ego trying to cling on and survive_comma_ i've passed that point_comma_ but after looking clearly you'll see there is more than just this dimension and that is just a simple fact_comma_ science tells us this too_comma_ it's not about feeling good or feeling comfortable with death_comma_ it's about growing 	1 
the world is such a disgusting place now_comma_ i wish i was born back in the 70s 	0 
Yeah_comma_ 70s were incredible_comma_ the dancing the cars_comma_ the women had style and the music was incredible.	0 
RIGHT?! but now is just so bad_comma_ i wish i could go back	0 
But we got to make the best of it_comma_ pretty soon elon musk will release flying cars and then life will be amazing again.	1 
today everyone said congratulations to me_comma_ as i succeed in making an amazing app_comma_ and now i am so greatful to be alive! 	0 
Congratulations on your success! I bet you worked incredible hard to achieve your goals.	0 
thank you! it's always nice to tell you these things_comma_ you don't get jealous and you are just happy for me_comma_ thank you	0 
There will always be people that are jealous of your success_comma_ but it is up to you to be the bigger person and handle it with grace.	1 
I came home from work today to a disaster. My dog chewed up the new couch i just purchased.	0 
Oh no_comma_ can you return it or get a refund?	0 
No I didnt purchase insurance. When i saw it my blood was boiling!	0 
I am sorry to hear that_comma_ I would have felt the same way. 	0 
yeah. Im so upset i cant even think right nowl	1 
I gave my dog away to a family today. I did not have time for him since work and school take alot of it up.	0 
That has got to be rough. At least it has a home now that hopefully has more time.	0 
I agree_comma_ but im praying they will take care of him. hes just a puppy.	0 
I'm sure they will be great to him and he'll bring them joy as well!	0 
Yeah thats all i can ask for.	1 
I saw my girlfriend getting real friendly with another guy at the bar last night	0 
OH no! Are you the jealous type?	0 
It definitely had me feeling a little uneasy about the whole situation.	0 
OH man! Yeah I would of felt the same way!	1 
I have a test coming up next week.	0 
oh no do you feel ready for it? 	0 
I'm super ready for it! I spent so much time studying over the last week.	0 
That is great_comma_ I believe that you will do amazing! 	1 
I AM SO ANNOYED! i have been trying to solve this math problem for 2 hours now	0 
Oh that sounds really annoying. maybe you can look it up online or get someone to help?	0 
there isn't any solution it's a century award i am working on_comma_ it's the problem of non-polynomial descent 	0 
Oh I see_comma_ well good luck to you_comma_ I hope you'll solve it soon.	1 
I'm really feeling alright about how my life is going right now.	0 
That is great_comma_ what has been going on in your life recently?	0 
I've just been getting things done. Nothing has been going amazing but nothing really sucks either.	0 
That is good_comma_ sometimes that is all you really need to do_comma_ get things done  one step at a time :) 	1 
The ads for the new World Of Warcraft expansion really makes me think about when I played it many years ago.	0 
They looked really exciting! Does it make you want to play it again?	0 
It does. I put so much time in that game before. I might have to pick it up again.	0 
If it makes you happy then you should do it! Capitalize on that nostalgic feeling while you can.	1 
I woke up to something super annoying this morning.	0 
That is always frustrating. What happened?	0 
I woke up to find out my car was sideswiped while it was parked by the curb during the night. No note or anything.	0 
Wow_comma_ some people are just terrible! I hate when people don't take responsibility for their actions.	1 
I'm really disappointed in my son's actions that I was told about.	0 
What did he do?	0 
He got caught cheating by his teacher on a test the other day.	0 
Oh no. What do you think caused him to do that?	0 
Probably because he did not study enough so was unprepared.	1 
I ate such a disgusting thing the other day by accident.	0 
What was it that you accidentally ate?	0 
I bought a sandwich and after a few bite I noticed that there was a bunch of mold.	0 
Eww that sounds horrible! Were you able to get a refund at least?	0 
I was!	1 
I recently had my first child.  I was absolutely terrified when I went into labour but I put all my faith in the wonderful midwives and everything worked out perfectly!	0 
I'm glad it went as planned. I can imagine that to be a very stressful moment.	0 
it really was its just so scary but I had to believe the experience and caring nature of the midwives would get my through it and it did.  I really admire anyone in that career_comma_ its not just a job but a vocation.	0 
You've really got to be committed to go into work like that. It's not for everybody_comma_ I agree.	0 
Indeed.  The really do work with life and death everyday.	1 
I started a diet today and just as soon as I get home I eat a burger!	0 
I know how hard diets are to stick to. What foods are you avoiding?	0 
Fried foods. I feel bad I didn't commit to it the first day. 	0 
Don't be too hard on yourself_comma_ it's hard to quit something immediately. Just keep trying_comma_ I believe in you!	0 
Thank you! I need that motivation so I can get over this shame im feeling. 	0 
I get it. There is always another meal to start making the change!	1 
I'm so not looking forward to tomorrow.	0 
Why not? What happens tomorrow?	0 
I have to talk to a large group at work tomorrow. 	0 
Don't let it worry you too much. Just make sure you organize everything you need to present and remember to speak loudly and clearly! You can do it!	1 
I changed my shift to overnight and walking to my care gave me the creeps tonight. There was a man standing in the dark.	0 
That sounds creepy! Is there any chance someone could start escorting you to your car? There is strength in numbers!	0 
I agree. I had goosbumps all over and chills down my spine. 	0 
I definitely recommend getting some mace and a pocket knife. Stay safe out there!	1 
My brother is going into surgery tomorrow.	0 
I hope that all goes well. I am sure he will be good as new after!	0 
I'm really hoping so! I've been really worried.	0 
I am sure the procedure will go excellently.	1 
Today my friend had all of is awe_comma_ becasue she won the singing contest at work. She is so shy and no one would have ever known she could sing. 	0 
That's really cool! I bet people really underestimated that underdog!	0 
I agree! I was amazed with her performance. She did really well.	0 
That's awesome! Maybe she'll come out of her shell.	0 
I hope so. She is very talented. Who would have known. 	1 
I have such a fear of flying_comma_ so you can just imagine how I felt when my husband bought us a sky diving voucher for my 30th birthday! He was so excited and I was so nervous and uneasy.	0 
He's a brave man. How was the experience?	0 
Well the day came and off we travelled.  We arrived at the place only to find all our friends and family there to cheer us on.  Up we went in the plane and of course while the lovely instructors tried to reassure me the whole time_comma_ i tried desperately to keep my breakfast down!  However after the nerves and initial panic when we jumped out_comma_ it was actually one of the most amazing experiences of my life!	0 
It sounds incredible! Hopefully it helped you conquer your fear!	0 
It certainly did.  I would definitely recommend it.  My husband though is another story.  He has a fear of the sea and underwater so you can just guess what I will be buying him for his next big birthday haha.	1 
I was so worried that I could not pay for my tuition this semester. Thankfully my boss decided to give us a big bonus. 	0 
Congratulations! Worrying about tuition is the absolute worst panic!	0 
Yeah and its the last one before I graduate! I can be more thankful for his generosity. 	0 
You're going to kill it this semester! You're going to be so proud when you're walking down the aisle to get handed your degree.	0 
Thanks for the kind words. I cant be more happy and excited to be done!	1 
I was doing a big clear out recently and stumbled accross my old high school year book.  It is a long time since I left school and couldnt believe I even still had it.  Such a feeling of nostalgia looking at the old photos and reading the stories.	0 
Did you guys write still write notes in each others' books in high school?	0 
Yes!  I laughed and sometimes cried a bit reading through those_comma_ especially from some old friends that are no longer with here.  It even brought up some great memories of prom and our school leaving party.	0 
It's amazing how many feelings and memories mementos like that can bring back.	0 
Indeed.  It definitely made my clear out day much more enjoyable.	1 
So i just bought a brand new corvette and I let my friend barrow it to go out of town. 	0 
That's awesome! Hopefully it comes back in one piece.	0 
I agree! She will take care of it. I have faith she will bring it back the way she got it! lol	0 
I think it will be fine. I bet the new car runs well.	0 
Yeah it does. I never let anybody drive my car_comma_ but I felt I could let her since she is responsible. 	1 
My husband wont be back for a month due to work and Im here at the house by myself.	0 
Im sure that is tough.  You must really miss him.	0 
Yeah i have no pets or children so im just here in an empty house. 	0 
Do you get nervous being on your own?	0 
Nah just bored. Im new to this city so I dont know anybody either. 	0 
Oh that sounds even tougher.  It is a long time but I hope it flies by for you and your hubby is back home again.	0 
Yea I agree! II feel so helpless being home by myself. 	0 
Im sure your not though! 	1 
I had the worst experience last weekend.  I woke up to find someone had stolen my car! I was in absolute shock just couldnt believe it.	0 
Thats horrible! Did you get the police involved?	0 
Well yes.  While i was in my daze_comma_ absolutely horrified_comma_ my level headed husband did all the practical things like contact the police and insurance company etc.	0 
Yeah i would have felt the same way. 	0 
Thankfully the insurance company sorted my out with a courtesy car for now but still cant believe there are people out there that do such terrible things!	0 
yeah it unfortunate we have to worry about things like this.	0 
true but in time I finally did see that its not the end of the world_comma_ its just a car that can be replaced but that initial overwhelming feeling was awful.	1 
Today after a long day at work I sat in traffic for 2 hours due to construction on the freeway!	0 
That's a ton of traffic. I hope they finish their project soon	0 
Me too! I get so frusterated because there are no back roads to my house so I have to go through this for the next 2 weeks. 	0 
That's unfortunate. I wish we could fly sometimes.	0 
Me too_comma_ so i wouldn't have to deal with wasted time!	1 
My old friend suprised me with a phone call today. I have not heard from her since high school. 	0 
How lovely!  I such it was so nostalgic to talk about old times together.	0 
Yes it was. I cant wait for our reunion so we can catch up on more!	0 
That is a brilliant idea.  There is nothing better than catching up with old friends.	0 
Yes the things we remember and ponder about are the greatest!	1 
A little stray pup appeared on my driveway yesterday.  My initial reaction was to contact the local pet shelter.  However no one had reported him.  I decided to take him in_comma_ wash him and feed him.  I have never been much of an animal person but I couldnt believe how much i felt for this poor wee puppy.	0 
Awe your such a caring and loving person! Are you going to keep it?	0 
I didnt think I was but he has won my heart.  No one claimed him_comma_ even after posters being put around so yes he has officially become part of the family.  To be honest I was glad no owner came forward_comma_ I would never have wanted to give him up in the end he has just stolen my heart!	0 
The love and care you show him will bring him joy and happiness! 	0 
Just as he does to us.	1 
I got super wasted. I accidentally messed myself in front of people	0 
Oh wow_comma_ that must've been a hard situation. Especially later when you were more in control again.	0 
Yeah. That was the day I decided to no longer drink	0 
That sounds like a good decision. Good luck!	1 
I'm really excited for this next weekend!	0 
What's happening this weekend? I hope you have some good things planned.	0 
A friend that has been living overseas for the last year or so is going to come back to visit finally!	0 
That's awesome! I'm very excited for you this is a good event for you!	1 
I had a really scary experience the other day.	0 
That's interesting. Are you okay?	0 
Yeah_comma_ I'm fine. My friend got into a car crash while I was in the car though.	0 
That's bad news. I hope that everyone is healthy and doing well.	1 
I went camping the other day and had a rlly bad experience during it.	0 
Why what happened?	0 
I ended up getting lost for a bit in the woods which was not fun. Luckily_comma_ I made it back to my group at some point.	0 
Oh sounds scary!  I would have been scared.	1 
When I was a teenager I used to borrow my big sisters clothes without her knowledge.  One time she had just bought a lovely new dress after saving all her wages.  That weekend I borrowed it and of course ripped it!  The next day when she found out she was so angry and i felt terrible.	0 
Oh no! I hope she's forgiven you since then.	0 
oh yes she has_comma_ it was a while ago now but at the time the guilt was awful.  Needless to say I learnt my lesson and never borrowed her clothes again!	0 
That's probably a good idea.	0 
Yes just a pity I had to learn the hard way.	1 
My last day of work was yesterday. I got so emotional driving home and I cried.	0 
I'm sorry to hear you were upset! Why did you have to quit?	0 
Im going back to school full time. I was there for more than 10 years. I will miss everyone. 	0 
Wow that is a long time! Hopefully you can stay in touch with all of your former coworkers.	0 
Yeah just thinking about it makes me want to tear up. 	1 
Yesterday I found my boyfriend with someone else!	0 
hmmn_comma_ really?..i guess you must have felt very bad	0 
I was gonna explode. Im so fed up with him. Im so done.	0 
am so sorry about that_comma_ did he apologize?	0 
He doesnt know I know_comma_ but he will soon when i throw his stuff out	1 
One time when I was younger I wore a Halloween costume that I'd been looking forward to show off.  But I ended up covering myself up with a cape_comma_ because I was self conscious of how I looked.	0 
Aww- I'm sorry that happened. Why were you embarrassed?	0 
Well the costume itself ended up looking great_comma_ since my mom made it.  But I hadn't realized how fat I looked when i wore it_comma_ so I felt bad.	0 
It's always difficult when you feel self-conscious - but I've learned that people rarely judge you as hard as you judge yourself. 	0 
That's true_comma_ but no matter how much I tell myself that I always end up thinking about it too much about it.  I'm constantly worrying about what people think of me.	0 
Please try to be kinder to yourself! You are a great person- with a lot to offer. Always remember to be good to yourself.	1 
Whom do you belive the most	0 
In reference to what?	0 
Your trustful person?	0 
My husband is my most trusted companion.	0 
Oh_comma_ How much did you like him	1 
my father couldn't stope any lower_comma_ how can someone take money from their own child	0 
That's horrible! I'm a parent and I could never take money from my child. Did you confront him?	0 
i did many times_comma_ but he threatens to kick me out and ruin everything	0 
How frustrating! Keep your head held high and be strong. One day you'll be able to keep him from taking your money.	1 
my wife is always there for me_comma_ so i trust her more than anybody and i dont want to have any friends otehr than her_comma_ she is my faith	0 
That's really nice_comma_ however_comma_ to keep the marriage fresh and strong_comma_ I think it's important for you to have outside friends.	0 
that's only normie talk_comma_ we are both introverted and we hate people	0 
Haha_comma_ well I do know the feeling. I guess if it works for you_comma_ then don't change anything.	1 
i am a joke_comma_ i am ashemed of what i did	0 
what did you do???	0 
i builied someone because they made fun of my mother_comma_ but the person had difficulties walking already and i buillied i can't believe i did that	0 
well im sure you'll get over it. nobody should make fun of our mothers	1 
I  waited 3 years for them to realise season 3 and they promised it was to be released today_comma_ i was so devastated when i found out that they had to postpone it even more :/ it's just so annoying	0 
stay hopeful! _comma_ they'll release it sooner or later	0 
i hope so :<	0 
it's all gonna be fine and you'll get what u want.	1 
I still have a favorite stuffed animal of mine that I've had since I was young.  It's still in pretty good condition and reminds me a lot of my childhood.	0 
That is so sweet. It is wonderful to have things that bring back these beautiful memories. 	0 
Yeah_comma_ it is.  I always like to keep things that mean a lot to me and this was a gift from my mom so it's even more special.	0 
That really does make it special. I'm glad you have that. 	1 
a young girl_comma_ crying_comma_ sadden by the cruelity of our elders_comma_ told me about all these feelings i began to cry and became very sentimental	0 
....what feelings? what are you talking about	0 
she said that the elder man approached her and told her she is dumb and that made her very sad and upset	0 
oh man_comma_ that's rough to hear from someone older than you. is she ok?	1 
i am so envious of my sister_comma_ she has everything i just want to make her life hell	0 
That doesn't sound very good_comma_ but jealousy is a hard thing to deal with	0 
yeah but only i should get everything! no one else	0 
Other people deserve to have things_comma_ too.	1 
i am so embaressed at myself... i cant believe i fell down the stairs and my pants fell and my behind was exposed to the whole crowd 	0 
Oh no! When that happens you have to get up and yell_comma_ "Safe!"	0 
indeed_comma_ but this time i was red and yelling in my head	0 
Awww_comma_ well it happens to everyone sometimes. Just try to forget it. 	1 
don't you think life is peaceful? are you content?	0 
eh not really. what about you	0 
i did_comma_ espcially today when i woke up_comma_ i realised how everything is meaningful and how i can't just waste my life chasing after money and stupid things like that_comma_ so i decided to work hard on becoming free	0 
and what does that mean practically? what will you do differently?	0 
i will work on the things i enjoy_comma_ which is knowledge and learning more and go for nature walks more often	0 
i love walking in nature. hiking is a great way to exercise and to explore the outdoors	1 
I've known my best friend since I was 4 years old.  He joined the Air Force after high school and moved out of state and I was really upset when he left.	0 
Oh it's always sad when someone you care about leaves. Can you at least keep in contact with him?	0 
Oh yeah_comma_ we still keep in contact over the Internet daily and visit each other every few years.  But I miss when we used to hang out every day.	0 
I know. It is hard to say goodbye to people but he is doing a wonderful thing at least. 	1 
the future is so uncertain and yet so certain i am so not ready for what's about to come it fills mee with anxiety and depression just thinking about it	0 
Everything is going to be okay. Try to relax. 	0 
i hope so	0 
If there is something in particular_comma_ try to deal with it head on. 	1 
I have been spending a year learning a new skill and after so much study and hard work it is finally paying off. I am feeling faithful again. 	0 
that is great.. may i know what you have learnt	0 
I have been learning to trade on the Forex markets.	0 
it is challenging i guess.. best wishes that you developed skill over it	0 
Thank you sir_comma_ have a great day!	0

tomorrow i have interview and i have done my study so i am feeling confident	0 
I bet you will do great! What job is the interview for?	0

That's a great field. My daughter just got a degree in art but she hasn't been able to find a job yet. Good luck tomorrow!	0 
thank you! i have a freelaning job at art already but i just want the qualifcation for more_comma_ maybe your daughter can do the same thing	1 
I did so well in that biology exam haha_comma_ i anticipated those questions to come up i was so ready	0 
Good for you. Being prepared is always better than the alternative.	0 
yup! defiently_comma_ i am so amazing 	0 
Don't get too cocky but enjoy your victory you deserve it.	1 
i am so mad at myself_comma_ i woke up late again today and missed a very important deadline_comma_ even though i set 4 alarms	0 
Oh no! You must feel really bad. Are you able to fix the problem?	0 
no_comma_ i can't i just need to fix myself as  i am the problem	0 
Please try not to be so hard on yourself! We all make mistakes.	1 
I really hate going to the doctor. I was hesitant about going this time.	0 
Why do you need to go to the doctor?	0 
I had a painful cyst and I knew I would have to get a needle.	0 
Oh that's terrible. Did they take care of it?	1 
I was planning on going to grad school and I told a lot of people. I ended up not going_comma_ and I felt embarrassed every time someone asked me about how school was going.	0 
That sounds very uncomfortable. Were you honest with them about your change of plans?	0 
Yes. Without really giving details_comma_ I always kind of shrugged off their questions and told them that it didn't work out.	0 
Right. 	1 
I found a picture of my daughter and me from when I took her to a waterfall a long time ago. It brought tears to my eyes.	0 
Oh I bet that was amazing! I have a memory of going to a waterfall with my parents when I was young and it's a nice thing to think back on. Does your daughter remember it?	0 
Yes she does. Of course she doesn't see the sentimentality of it yet as I do. She is only 23. 	0 
One day she'll look back and it will mean so much to her! Memories with parents are the best ones.	1 
I have the worst fear of carnival rides_comma_ i always think they	0 
I totally understand_comma_ I hate carnival rides too_comma_ they always feel so rickety. Do you have a particular one you fear the most?	0 
(pressed enter too early). I love thrill rides_comma_ but i don't trust any carnival ride that gets rebuilt every time the fair opens up_comma_ too many horror stories. I mostly hate the ones that spin you a million different directions.	0 
Agreed_comma_ a good theme park is nice because you know they have high safety standards_comma_ but those carnival ones scare the crap out of me.	1 
My wife's cousin was sent to the hospital and was placed in a medically induced coma with something having to do with his lungs	0 
Oh my goodness! That sounds awful! Was this recently?	0 
Yes. They aren't sure what's wrong but his oxygen level is down to 40%	0 
I'm so sorry to hear that. Hopefully he has a good team of doctors that figure out what is going on. Are y'all able to visit him?	1 
I was on the highway during a strong thunderstorm_comma_ no visibility. I had a bad feeling someone bad was going to happen and no more than 10 minutes later two cars in front of me crash and one gets flipped over.	0 
That's so scary!  You must have strong intuition	0 
Yeah I honestly don't but the whole mood on that highway just felt right for that to happen. A lot of people weaving and having their hazards on for no reason.	0 
I'm so glad you came out of it okay.  I hate driving in bad weather and reckless driving just makes it worse.	1 
Walking to a restaurant the other day and I forgot to hold the door open for an old lady_comma_ felt so bad about it because she was right next to the door too.	0 
It was nice of you to at least think of it. I'm sure she wasn't that upset.	0 
I hope so_comma_ i usually hold it open for everybody but i was distracted and didn't see her.	0 
It's totally understandable. Life can get really busy sometimes!	1 
I bought a new phone recently and not long after i dropped it and shattered the screen_comma_ first time this happens and it was just terrible.	0 
Oh_comma_ that's not good. Did you get a warranty for the phone?	0 
No I usually don't since i've never dropped mines but I do get warranty now. It wasn't a cheap repair either.	0 
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that everything works out for you.	1 
I was disgusted when my dog tried to attack another dog	0 
Did the other dog provoke him? I wouldn't stress it too much_comma_ its just natural behavior for them_comma_ take him to training school.	0 
Not really_comma_ but he knows better. I think I will get a trainer.	0 
Oh then yeah_comma_ invest in a trainer. I love dogs a lot but an aggressive dog is very dangerous.	1 
Saw an old cassette of my cousins fifteens and saw my mother before she passed away_comma_ felt nice seeing her on video again.	0 
Oh I'm so sorry but I bet that was very special of you to find.	0 
Yeah sadly we don't have many videos of her but the few we have we keep them safe and stored.	0 
I would definitely make digital copies and upload to a cloud or a disk in case something happens.	1 
I got the scores for my final exam. got a B and passed the class_comma_ it was a good day to celebrate.	0 
That's awesome!  Congratulations!	0 
Yeah_comma_ i pampered myself and went with some friends to a Japanese sushi place.	0 
Nice choice!  Getting a B is definitely something to celebrate	1 
Ordered a new pair of headphones online. They are a really high end pair so I'm very excited to finally get them.	0 
That's exciting!  There's nothing like listening to your favorite music with great headphones	0 
Yeah_comma_ it really is a day and night difference. Let's you appreciate the intricacies of a song much better.	0 
I agree 100%.  Sounds like it's time to start downloading some new tunes to test out!	1 
My wife is having a hard time after finding out we can no longer have children. I am doing my best to support her and care for her but it is very hard when nothing seems to work.	0 
Oh thats heartbreaking_comma_ do you guys already have children?	0 
I do but she doesn't. Which makes it harder I think. All I can do is be there for her and hope time helps her heal.	0 
I really hope she gets better too_comma_ it must be terrible to know you cant have any kids. You're a good man for helping her cope.	1 
Back in middle school i had a crush on a girl and one day in class she was talking to another guy. I was jealous for a while but it didn't matter anyways. I ended up getting her.	0 
Young love_comma_ it's such a bittersweet quest.	0 
It is_comma_ those were the funnest days. No responsibilities.	0 
I know right? I wish I was young again sometimes.	1 
I had a lot of feelings when I found pictures of my dog who has passed.	0 
It's always difficult losing a pet.  I'm sure you had a flood of positive memories and sadness than they're gone	0 
It was very bittersweet. She could not work her legs anymore due to age.	0 
You just have to remember what a good life she had with you!	1 
I moved to my current town one year ago and I really like it here. I'm happy and couldn't think of a better place to live.	0 
Nice! Why do you like it more than other places you've lived?	0 
It's my first time living in a small town. I love the fresh air. I have also met some great people.	0 
That's good! I've always heard that people are closer friends to each other in a small town.	0 
Either that_comma_ or people are just nosier and love getting into each other's business! Just kidding. I think the slower pace of life just makes people nicer.	1 
I very much could count on my mom to always be there for me.	0 
That's a blessing.  I know a lot of people didn't have a mom like that.	0 
Me too. I am so thankful for her.	0 
Is there anything she does specifically for her?	1 
I was upset when I failed my math test	0 
I'm sorry. I know how that feels. Did you study really hard?	0 
I did_comma_ but the material was a hard subject.	0 
Oh_comma_ okay. Maybe you should ask your teacher for some extra help or find a study buddy. i hope you do better next time.	1 
I'm glad I can trust my husband to always be there for me.	0 
That's sweet! I have a great husband too! How long have you been married?	0 
Just under two years. Still feel like a newlywed@	0 
That's great! We've been married for almost 10 years and I still feel like a newlywed. It's great when you marry your best friend.	1 
Hi friend! Wow_comma_ I was so scared of this taxi driver when I was vacationing in Mexico. He looked rather suspicious.	0 
Oh gosh! That sounds frightening! Did you get out the taxi as soon as you could?	0 
No_comma_ I just trusted him. But I wrote all his details in my phone just in case. 	0 
Oh_comma_ well that was a smart thing to do. I would've bailed. lol	0 
Yeah but the car was on the highway and I could not get out. Thankfully everything was alright. Never again though!	1 
I was storing all of my old photos on my new external hard drive yesterday. It made me wish I could go back and time and see some relatives again.	0 
I usually love the trips down memory lane_comma_ but the sad side of it are the ones who are no longer around. I'm sorry.	0 
It's bittersweet! Nice to see their faces again_comma_ but sad to miss them.	0 
I'm right there with you. It makes you shed a tear sometimes too.	1 
I lied to my friend about something and told her something was okay when it really wasn't	0 
Oh. I know lying is sometimes beneficial in some situations. Hopefully you did this to protect someone's feelings	0 
I just felt really bad and guilty that I did it.	0 
Yeah_comma_ I think that means you have a conscience_comma_ which is a good thing. If you didn't feel bad_comma_ I'd worry about you!	1 
Sometimes a fly gets in my apartment and I hold my cat over my head and we chase it. She hasn't scratched or bitten me once while we do this!	0 
That would make a funny video! We have a super friendly_comma_ playful cat too.	0 
I love cats. They're so funny and such good company!	0 
Yes_comma_ they are. He is my daughter's best friend. She can do whatever she wants and he is unphased.	1 
I babysat my nephew overnight last weekend. He was scared so I let him sleep in bed with me_comma_ even though he kicks a lot.	0 
That was thoughtful_comma_ sometimes i think kids fake being scared just to not be alone. hope you didn't get kicked too much!	0 
Haha I didn't sleep a wink. He's only 8. He pretends to be all cool_comma_ but he's still very much a little kid.	0 
Kids are interesting creatures that's for sure. I'm sure you got some cool uncle points.	0 
I'm an auntie :p	0 
My mistake :)	1 
my pet dog is always there for me. No matter what_comma_ I can count on her.	0 
I feel the same way about my dog.  They're the greatest!	0 
yes they are they are always happy to see you and they will always there for you	0 
I don't know what I would do without my dog.  I'm glad you have one that's always there for you!	1 
I had a great breakfast this morning. It was delicious and I felt very happy and relaxed.	0 
Nice! What did you have? I am planning to serve breakfast for dinner tonight.	0 
Eggs_comma_ bacon_comma_ strawberries_comma_ tomatoes_comma_ and coffee. So yummy!	0 
Mmmm. that sounds really good! I'm thinking biscuit and sausage gravy_comma_ hash brown and eggs...	1 
I called someone by the wrong name earlier today. I didn't really know them and hadn't seen them in ages.	0 
I hate when that happens. I bet you meant well but you're left looking like a crazy person! I hope they understood.	0 
They were ok with it_comma_ but I hope I didn't hurt their feelings.	0 
I think they will get over it. Most people understood that not everyone is going to remember every little thing.	1 
The other day we were in the front yard_comma_ and you won't believe what happened!	0 
What happened? The yard always has mysteries!	0 
My 4 year-old just dropped his pants and started peeing in the grass!	0 
Shocking! Has your kid done that before?	0 
No!  All of the neighbors were out there_comma_ too!	1 
I got into an argument with my husband and I realized later that he was right but I never apologized. :(	0 
Maybe you should find him and apologize right now.	0 
Yes maybe I should but my ego gets in the way.	0 
You could just cook him a nice dinner or plan a special date instead. 	0 
That is a cool idea! Thanks for the great advice! I will do that right now. :)	0 
Your welcome! Glad I could help!	1 
I'm unemployed and struggling right now. I feel really bad when people talk to me about their new stuff_comma_ even though they're not trying to be mean	0 
I can understand the feeling_comma_ I went through a couple of spells like that in the past. I'm sure they mean well but you're at a point where you're hurting to get back out there.	0 
yeah! I just want to be able to support myself and not go to the food bank or rely on friends and family	0 
You'll return to self-sufficiency soon_comma_ you just can't let yourself fall into a pit of self doubt. Stay confident.	1 
I am so sad. My 3 dogs attacked my baby goat and she died last night from the injuries. Crying....	0 
Aww_comma_ that's so sad. I'm an animal lover so I understand the pain.	0 
It hurts really bad and I don't know what to do. I think I should give some dogs away to a family with no small animals.	0 
That's a really tough decision either way. I wish you the best with it and hope everything improves	0 
Thanks for listening my friend.	1 
One of my love birds had a baby but she is a terrible mother. So I am now taking care of the baby and feeding her everyday. She is so cute!	0 
Ah what a responsibly to take on! You are a great example_comma_ is it quite tough?	0 
No. The baby bird just sleeps and eats do it is really easy. 	0 
Alot easier than a kitten or a puppy then?	0 
Yes! I think so_comma_ haha!	0 
Keep up the good work!	1 
I feel very happy that I moved out in the country. I thought I was a city person but I guess not.	0 
I bet you can see the stars and hear all sorts of wildlife at night.	0 
Oh yes. It was hard to get used to at first but now I barely notice it.	0 
All that outside noise can become so soothing if you left it.	0 
Yes I think so. I especially enjoy this night owl that hoo's everynight.	0 
Living out in the woods can really make you put things in perspective too.	0 
Sure does. Your welcome to visit any time my friend.	0 
Thanks that is quite the offer. How kind.	1 
I really wanted to go on this fruitarian trip to Bali butI could not get off work. My friends went without me	0 
Did you wait until the last minute to ask for time off?	0 
No. My boss is not a very nice person. I think I should find a new job.	0 
Yeah you might want to look into it then	0 
Thanks for your advice my friend!	1 
My dog is feeling sick and I don't know what is wrong.	0 
Oh no! Have you tried taking your dog to the vet?	0 
I hate the vets. They charge so much money. Maybe I can google seomthing.	0 
Yes_comma_ google has a lot of great information for pet care.	0 
Thanks fo your advice my friend!	1 
I am learning how to do day trading and did my first trade and I won	0 
Well that sounds like a high stress occupation!	0 
You think? It sure is exciting_comma_ at least when I win.	0 
I'm glad you like it. I think it would be hard to get it right every time the way the market is sometimes.	0 
Your right. Let's see how I do next week.	0 
I wish you the very best with it all!	0 
Thanks my friend!	0 
You're welcome. Be careful not to chase stocks too hard_comma_ they don't always turn the way you might hope!	1 
My dogs keep attacking my poor ducks. I don't know what to do	0 
I don't know what you can do. A duck is just a toy that taste good to a dog.	0 
I scream at the dogs and it seems to be working but I never know what can happen in the future.	0 
Dogs gonna do dog stuff. That's just how they do.	0 
Yep. Talk to later my friend.	1 
I packing to go on an international trip. I hope I don't forget anything.	0 
That would be bad you should double check before you leave	0 
I feel I can't fit anything else in my suitcase so I think I have it all. But I will double check like you said. :)	0 
Yeah it is better to be safe than sorry	0 
You are so right! See you when I get back my friend!	1 
I was ashamed when my dog started barking loudly when I was away.	0 
Why were you ashamed? Did she disturb the neighbors or something?	0 
Yes_comma_ my neighbors were very angry.	0 
I'm sorry that happened. You might need to get her obedience training_comma_	1 
I am exciting that my father said he would come and visit me soon. He travels so much and it is hard to get his time	0 
Thats awesome! do yall have any plans? 	0 
We are just going to hang out on the farm and hang out with the cows_comma_ ha ha	0 
lol maybe yall could find something to bond over	0 
We have a great relationship so just each others company is good enough.	1

ugh_comma_ I have a cavity and I do not want to go to the dentist	0 
Oh no_comma_ is it painful and disrupting you in anyway? 	0 
its painful but the thought of it being pulled kind of freaks me out plus the cost of it.	0 
Yeah_comma_ I know what you mean it does sound very scary_comma_ but they do numb your face and usually they do not pull it out_comma_ they fill in the cavity! 	1 
We didn't really have anything planned this last weekend_comma_ so were thinking we'd be productive.	0 
What did you do?	0 
Well_comma_ plans got changed.  It rained like crazy_comma_ so we couldn't work outside.	0 
It has been raining a lot here too. Definitely ruins a weekend planned outside of the house.	0 
It was okay_comma_ though. We got to spend some time hanging out and had a low-key weekend.	0 
That's good_comma_ sometimes it's good to just be lazy inside the house.	1 
I still haven't been able to finish my dad's Father's Day gift.	0 
so are you making him a gift?	0 
Yeah_comma_ we're rebuilding a porch swing for him.  But I've had to hunt down some tooling.	0

Have you always had a fear of flying?  I haven't ever really feared it_comma_ but I don't like it.	1 
Man_comma_ I really thought today could be a crazy day.	0 
Was it another boring day today? 	0 
Well_comma_ it sort of turned out that way.  There was a big event at work today_comma_ and I wasn't sure how it would go.	0 
Ohh okay I see_comma_ yeah I always get excited when new things happen at work too. 	1 
over the weekend i  fell off my diet by eating a big bag of peanut M&Ms	0 
I know the feeling. Hang in there! tomorrow is always a new day 	0 
you know the worst part of it_comma_ is that i hid it from my partner who is proud of me dieting_comma_ i feel bad for it	0 
Did you hide the wrappers?	1 
I always buy the same brand of yogurt and don't even bother trying other kinds. It's just so delicious and such a good price that I'm a loyal customer for life	0 
There's very few brands I feel that strongly about. What kind of yogurt is it_comma_ I might want to try it?	0 
Astro balkan plain! It's not as pastey as greek yogurt_comma_ or runny like other kinds	0 
I don't think I have ever seen that kind in the store_comma_ I'll have to look for it next time I go. I don't care much for the runny yogurt_comma_ but I like greek yogurt so long as it's whole fat and sweet.	1 
I lost my job because I got diagnosed with a chronic disease. It's a real double whammy - loss of income and an incurable disease. I'm still angry and upset_comma_ three months later.	0 
That is horrible. Americas government wont be of help....hopefully you have family?	0 
No I'm all by myself	0 
No cat or dog?	1 
Have you ever had a strong attachment and love for an animal?   I have had several.	0 
Yes I love animals and have 3 dogs right now.	0 
Well then you will understand the love I had for my pitbull named Lily.   We had a special bond and when she died it broke my heart.  Never leave a candle burning and leave the house.   OUr house burned and she died of smoke inhalation.  I will never forget her!	0 
I'm sorry that happened to you and I will take your advice.	1 
Once during a snowstorm I had to go to the airport. My taxi driver decided that driving on the highway in the middle of nowhere late at night was the perfect time to tell me all about how he would kill a man	0 
That sounds super scary_comma_ could he tell that your were scared or nervous? How did you escape that situation?	0 
I shrank into myself and prayed for the car to go faster and not crash	0 
Oh wow_comma_ it's fortunate that you managed to get out of that situation alive. I'm glad you made it out of that awful situation. 	1 
One time there was a homeless guy running towards my car	0 
That sounds a little scary. Why was he running towards your car?	0 
He wanted money!	0 
Did you give him any?	0 
NO!	1 
I'm really stressed today so I bought a box of Pirate peanut butter cookies and ate an entire sleeve of them. I feel pretty bad because I wrecked my dieting for at least two days	0 
Aww_comma_ I am sorry_comma_ but I must say Pirate peanut butte cookies do sound good_comma_ did they help you feel any better?	0 
In the short term_comma_ yes! They're oatmeal and peanut butter	0 
Ugh_comma_ that sounds wonderful_comma_ I would do the same if I were stressed I think	1 
One time I saw a person juggle chainsaws	0 
That's amazing. Were you impressed?	0 
Yes_comma_ he did it perfectly and did not hurt himself	0 
That must take a lot of practice. I can't even juggle safe objects so I'd likely lose an arm if I tried to juggle chainsaws lol	1 
I'm very ready for school to start!	0 
Me_comma_ too!  I work at the registration department at a college and we're very busy until school starts.	0 
There's just something so nostalgic about going to school. Reminds me of my childhood.	0 
I think it's the feeling of the beginning of something new.	1 
One time my mom made me lunch when I was too busy working!	0 
Wow that is so sweet of her. She must really love you! 	0

I work in video production. Super fun job_comma_ but I'm tired of the freelance life.	0 
That does sound like a really fun job. I also work freelance and would also like something more stable. 	1

Oh no_comma_ have you talked to him about it? 	0 
Yes! He is such a manchild! He does not care about cleanliness!	0 
Aww man_comma_ that sucks_comma_ I am guessing that you end up having to do all the dirty work because he has been slacking off. 	1 
I was so mad when my dog got my dinner off the table.	0 
Oh I would be pissed. Hopefully you had more so you could fix another plate.	0 
I did_comma_ but he knows better.	0 
Guessing he didn't get anymore food for dinner lol.	1 
I visited my college campus today and memories came flooding back. I miss it.	0 
I'd imagine so. What a great time of our lives college can be. The world just seems right_comma_ being surrounded by your peers_comma_ all sharing similar goals. 	0 
It was so great. We all just wanted to learn.	0 
Mmhm. I wish I studied more_comma_ paid more attention_comma_ and joined more clubs. But I guess that's the thing_comma_ you're already as busy as it gets_comma_ and unfortunately you can't experience it all.	1

Aw_comma_ that stinks. Why couldn't they come?	0 
My dad had to work last minute. I got everything ready for them. Oh well.	0 
That sounds really disappointing. Hopefully_comma_ you'll be able to see them soon! I'm sure they were excited too.	1 
I was grossed out when I saw someone vomiting at a bar.	0 
Oh man_comma_ I bet you did. I would have had a gag reflex if I saw some one puking at the bar. 	0 
They couldn't even make it to the bathroom. Ugh.	0 
Wow they must have had 1 too many drinks if they could not even get to the bathroom. I am sorry you had to see such a disgusting sight 	1 
I'm very scared of the afterlife	0 
Me too_comma_ it's so hard not knowing what to expect.	0 
And we do not even know if we have an afterlife.	0 
Right_comma_ no one truly knows until they get there_comma_ so scary.	1 
I was very happy just reading a book by the pool today	0 
What was the book about?	0 
It was about the golden state killer. Very errie.	0 
I'm glad you were happy reading the book.	1 
I was very nervous for my first day of freshman year in college.	0 
Oh_comma_ I understand. I also remember mine. Do you remember something else about that day?	0 
I could not find my classes. It was almost comical.	0 
I imagine it was a big college. what did happen at the end?	1 
One time I won a stuffed animal from the claw machine!	0 
Me too! I love that game!	0 
Yup_comma_ I did it in my first try too!	0 
I saw a machine one time that you could win live lobsters. They would cook it for you if you won.	1 
I was so happy when my mom came to visit me	0 
Nice! How long has it been since you last saw her?	0 
6 months. Way too long!	0 
Man_comma_ I hope you two do something fun!	1

I thought it was so cool that my friend did a backflip.	0 
Wow! that is really cool. Did he land the back flip?	0 
He did! I didn't know he could do that.	0 
What prompted his back flip?	1 
I forgot to invite my friend to dinner with our other friends.	0 
It happens sometimes.  It only becomes a problem if you forget often.	0 
Luckily I have not done it too many times.	0 
I hope they were pretty understanding.	1 
One time I wanted to eat at Burger King_comma_ but then I remembered that I was loyal to Mcdonalds	0 
I hate burger king! McD's all the way	0 
Your dam right! Even if the food is small_comma_ it tastes so good!	0 
Adding mac sauce to a cheeseburger is a game changer	1 
I was upset when I did not do well on a test.	0 
That is unfortunate_comma_ did you fail the test?	0 
Not exactly_comma_ but close enough. I will study better next time.	0 
You got this! I believe in you!	1 
I was so mad when my friend forgot my birthday	0 
Wow! Did you tell them anything?	0 
I did a few days later. They seemed sorry.	0 
You should stop being their friend!	1 
One time my friend said that I could tell him anything and she would snitch	0 
Oh_comma_ snitches are no fun.	0 
Yes_comma_ snitches get stiches	0 
I would just keep to myself.	1 
I remember years ago when I was a teenager.  I didnt treat her as well as I should have.	0 
Who?	0 
Oh so sorry_comma_ I meant to say I didnt treat my mother as well as I should have.  I often treated her with disrespect and disobedience.	0 
Well I think as long as you say sorry_comma_ she can forgive.	1 
My dog kept barking and waking me up	0 
I know how annoying that can be.  I love dogs but they certainly get do annoying things at times.	0 
I still do not know why he was barking.	0 
Maybe there was something outside or maybe he just wanted attention.   Dogs behavior can be hard to figure out sometimes.   Good Luck!	1 
One time I pooped my pants when I was trying to fart	0 
I have done that before. It is not fun.	0 
Yup! I had to walk home in shame!	0

Does it make you feel like you're living in an alternate reality?	1 
I did not like being alone at home at night.	0 
it can be scary at times. How do you deal with it?	0 
I try to go to bed earlier.	0 
That is a good way. I have a dog that makes me feel safe. Do you have anything like that?	1 
My family left for the weekend and I'm so bored.	0 
You can watch some movies	0

Wow_comma_ lucky you. I play those once in a year only	0 
I can understand that_comma_ as I usually dont have the money to play to very often.  I couldnt wait to go cash it in.  	0

I studied all night for a test. I think I can pass it_comma_ even though I was sleepy	0 
well that's good. what's the subject?	0 
Organic chemistry!	0 
I hate chemistry because I think we should leave all that stuff to nature and just live our lives as the animals we are	0 
I agree!	0 
do you have a good teacher?	1 
One time they gave me ketchup packets instead of spicy sauce. I was so mad!	0 
Wow that is annoying. Did you get a spicy packet after?	0 
No_comma_ I was pouting all day! 	0 
That is okay_comma_ mistakes happen all the time.	1 
One time when I was drinking coffee_comma_ all the memories of my childhood kept coming back	0

One time my mom bought an ice cream from Mcdonalds!	0 
Really? what kind of icecream?	0 
A plain vanilla one. It is rare since their machine is always broken!	0 
That is a good one! it is not always broken though. Sometimes they are out of ice cream mix because the workers eat it all	1 
One time when I was little_comma_ I was scared of going to sleep without a night light	0 
That is a rational fear when you are little. How did you overcome it?	0 
I became depressed and I felt nothing	0 
Oh that is a bad place to go	1

I feel you. I am still scared even though I am sort of successful now!	0 
it's that fear of not being able to control everything that hurts the most	0 
Uncertainty is the only certainty!	1 
I like to work with people who are fast on their feet and get things very fast.	0 
Have you always felt that way or have changed your view over time?	0 
That is just me_comma_we seem to get a lot of things done within a short period of time.	0

Yes totally agree! Maybe I should just leave and make them wait. Haha	0 
Yes_comma_ that would certainly give them a taste of their own medicine!	1 
It's really hard to stay disciplined and watch what you eat.	0

I've tried a few_comma_ and I would have to say the one that I liked the most was Weight Watchers. It's pretty easy to stay on_comma_ and the food is usually good. The only big problem is that it gets expensive.	0 
I think that that's a common problem with all of them.	1

i have to go out of town_comma_ i am not looking forward to flying	0 
I feel you_comma_ but at least it should be shorter than driving and the odds of a mishap are much lower than regular transportation.	0 
i keep telling myself flying is safe but I am petrified of getting on that plane	0 
I see_comma_ I think you may consider a tylenol or some type of sleep pill for the flight_comma_ to ensure that you don't feel uncomfortable or paranoid during travel.	1 
My father has been such a great father. He is such a hard worker and loves his family so much. He is such a great man.	0 
That's awesome. I was always a daddy's boy growing up.	0 
Awww_comma_ yeah Daddy's can be the best! I wish all children could have good daddy's.	0 
Amen. Mine was a good man. He taught me a lot of good life lessons.	1 
I have a stuffed animal that my old dog used to lay by/on as a pillow. My dog is dead but I still keep that stuffed animal to remind me of him	0 
I am sorry your dog passed away_comma_ I totally understand wanting to keep a momento to remind you of him. Was he old when he passed?	0 
He was about 12.  He was my first dog though! He was a sweetheart.  It is nice keeping something to remind me of him.	0 
I'm glad you have something that helps keep his memory alive. :)	0 
I do too! 	1 
I was hoping to get an interview for a higher position and was told I would get that at least.  However_comma_ the recruiter didnt look at internal candidates and by the time it was reported they had hired someone from the outside.	0 
Aw what a sham! Did they give any reason why they hired from the outside?	0 
My boss said the recruiter is an idiot and just never looked at internal candidates. It was a bummer but I figure I'll look for something else in the company soon	0 
Well that's a good attitude to have. I don't blame you for being mad. I would be.	0 
I was a little upset.  My boss and her boss were more angry than me though so I felt good they were at least on my side!	1 
I am getting a new car this week! I can't wait to smell the new leather seats!	0 
Oh man_comma_ that is exciting! Do you know what kind?	0 
It's a beautiful 2018 yellow jeep! The car of my dreams! So stoked!	0 
That's awesome!! I love jeeps!  congratulations_comma_ that's great news!	1 
A bird fell out of a tree next to my house. I am now the mother and taking care of her. We are developing such a beautiful relationship.	0 
That's so sweet.  What kind of bird is it?	0 
I think it is a love bird. She thinks I am the mother and it is so cool when she walks all over me and comes when I call her. I have never had a pet bird before.	0 
Aww_comma_ I'd love to see a video of that.	0 
Ok_comma_ I will make one for you. :)	1 
I met a cow the other day and I went to go pet her. Something inside me told me to get away. Later that day the owner told me to stay away from her because she is known to attack people.	0 
You're lucky the cow didnt hurt you.	0 
Yes I think so. That probably could have killed me. But I guess it was not my time. I angels saved me.	0 
Good thing you listened to your gut feeling	1 
I need to go to the grocery store but it is storming outside. Not sure if I should go or not.	0 
Hopefully it will stop soon. That's the worst having to get creative with the little food you have on hand.	0 
Actually I have no food and I am starving. Maybe I should order a pizza. But then the delivery guy will have the same problem.	0 
Well that is what they get paid for. Just be sure to tip him well.	1 
i came home yesterday_comma_ i found my sofa torn up_comma_ let's say this I am not very  happy with my pet dog	0 
Uh oh. I bet he knew he was in trouble. Did you get him a crate?	0 
i was on the verge of something more serious and probably would have regret it	0 
Yeah_comma_ I'm glad you didn't do anything you would regret. I hope he is better for you in the future.	1 
I am so hurt that my baby goat died. My dogs were playing to rough and killer her. Man I should have stopped it sooner. It is all my fault. :(	0 
Oh no! I'm so sorry about that. Don't blame yourself_comma_ animals like to play with each other!	0 
Yes but I think I could have avoided it. I am training my dogs now to stay away from the goats. I hope it doesn't happen again.	0 
That sounds like a good plan. You definitely don't want that to happen again. Sometimes bad things happen in order for us to learn and avoid it again.	1 
I went fishing with my 4 year-old about a month ago.	0 
That sounds great_comma_ I can remeber going fishing with my dad at that age. Did your 4 year-old have a good time?	0 
He did!  He caught 4 fish all by himself.	0 
Wow_comma_ that's impressive! I'm glad he had a good time.	1 
My dog was stung by a bug.  His lip got huge and looked really funny but I felt terrible for him!	0 
Poor doggy! Did you have to take him to the vet?	0 
I did end up taking him in. Luckily it wasnt too serious and he was fine a couple days later.  He looked so sad with his big lip!	0 
I bet he did_comma_ I'm glad he's okay though.	1 
my best friend friend helped me through some rough spots with my marriage and job. I am gland he was there for me	0 
Thats really nice you have a friend like that.That's hard to come by. I hope everything is better for you now.	0 
thank you_comma_ i do not know how i will repay him back_comma_ I will always be in his debt	0 
I'm sure he doesn't expect it but thats a really nice thing he did.	1 
I feel so bad to see so many homeless people on the streets these days. I hope I am never homeless.	0 
I hope you arent and I'm not too! It would be rough living on the streets.	0 
Yeah especially when it is snowing outside. Can you just imagine having to sleep outside like that . Oh! So sad!	0 
It would be terrible in the winter.  I cant imagine sleeping outside when its freezing	1 
I went out to eat with my girlfriend last week.  It was an awesome atmosphere and the food was great!	0 
That sounds fun! Where did you go?	0 
We went to a greek place.  There were belly dancers and a ton of good meats and appetizers. I think we'll check it out again this weekend since it was so fun!	0 
Mmmmm_comma_ I love greek food! That sounds appetizing! I think I will take my girl there too this week!	1 
as I walk through my house_comma_ the rooms are empty_comma_ There is no one there for me	0 
I'm so sorry you feel that way. Maybe you should talk to someone you trust. A family member or a friend.	0 
that is the problem there is no one I can talk to or share with	0 
I'm sorry. You could seek out a professional to talk to. Or you could just try meeting some new people.	1 
I have no children but I have a ton of animals. I love them all so much. They are my children.	0 
What kinds of pets do you have?	0 
I have chickens_comma_ ducks_comma_ parrots_comma_ cockatiels_comma_ budgies_comma_ peacocks_comma_ guinea pigs_comma_ dogs_comma_ goats and cows. haha 	0 
oh wow! you did say a ton! I love animals too. wish I lived somewhere I could have more.	0 
Yeah_comma_ it is so much fun to live with animals. :)	1 
When my son was born_comma_ we knew that something was up before he came out.  It was pretty scary.	0 
Did he have superpowers?	0 
Hah - no.  But he did have the cord wrapped around his neck twice_comma_ and he'd tied an overhand knot in it_comma_ too.	0 
That's pretty impressive.	1 
I was in a rush this morning and I dressed my self in stained clothes. I feel so dirty today. :(	0 
Oh wow_comma_ are you going to be in front of anyone important?	0 
Not today. I just feel insecure about it_comma_ like everyone is looking at me. It is probably just all in my head.	0 
Usually_comma_ you are the one who notices it the most. 	1 
My cows are finally pregnant. I can't wait for my baby calves to be born!	0 
wow_comma_ that must be an interesting thing to be involved with. lots of milk too_comma_ i presume.	0 
Oh_comma_ yes! Fresh raw milk is so wonderful and one of the best foods we can eat.	0 
very cool_comma_ wish i could get into something like that. sounds fun	1 
i miss my old pet dog_comma_ i feel so empty without her around	0 
Awww_comma_ I understand. Dogs are sooo great to be around and they are super friendly. 	0 
i know that what makes it harder not having her around_comma_ no companionship	0 
Maybe also looking into getting a new dog_comma_ I know it's hard_comma_ but you can get through it! Your friends and family are always there as well.	1 
I am so envious of those that can travel the world and get paid for it.	0 
That sounds like such an enjoyable life. If only it was so easy!	0 
Yeah_comma_ maybe in my next life I guess_comma_ haha.	0 
Haha_comma_ that is true. But we have to make the most of this one. 	1 
When I was in high school there was a senior I had a crush on and I was a sophomore.  I ended up asking her out but got rejected. Later on in college we actually became pretty good friends.	0 
Oh man heart breaker. Thats good yall are friends though. You never know maybe one day yall will be married	0 
Haha_comma_ I hope not...my current girlfriend would probably be a little upset! She's a nice person (the one from high school) but I dont think I could ever marry her	0 
you dont still have any feelings at all for her?	1 
I am learning how sew my own clothes. I am studying hard and I think I will be able to make my first outfit!	0 
Ooh_comma_ I've always wanted to learn how to do that. You must be so excited!	0 
Yes_comma_ I have so many ideas! How cool it would be to not have to buy any more expensive clothes and make my own! 	0 
Omg_comma_ that would be awesome. I might just have to learn how to do that myself.	1 
I just made a huge feast and now I am excited for all my guests to arrive to my baby shower!	0 
Ooo! That's exciting! Congrats on your baby! I hope your guests enjoy their time. 	0 
Thank you! I have so many fun games planned and lots of great food.	0 
Yay! That sounds like so much fun. Baby showers are a great way to bring everyone together.	1 
I trust the way my body feels to know if I'm generally healthy or not	0 
Usually it will let you know if something is wrong. Part of how we are designed! 	0 
Exactly! The human body is interesting!	0 
It is_comma_ everything has to be balanced just right_comma_ or else we feel it.	1 
I went to a restaurant and after I got the bill I realized that I did not have my wallet on me! The manager was yelling at me demanding me to pay before I left.	0 
Oh no_comma_ how did you make things right with the manager. I am sure he is just wanting to get paid. 	0 
Yes_comma_ he did want to get paid but I needed to go home and get my wallet. He got angry with me but what could I do? I had no money with me.	0 
That is a tough spot to be in_comma_ maybe you could of washed dishes for him. Or give him your phone for collateral. 	0 
I just left but I came straight back and paid. All was fine in the end. But I will never go to that restaurant again.	0 
That is good_comma_ such an embarrassing situation to be in.	1 
I really wanted an Oculus Rift.  I saved up enough and had to wait about a week before it was in stock at the store	0 
Oh man I want that too! did you get it?	0 
I did!  It is by far the coolest thing I have ever bought!	0 
Do you use your computer?	0 
yeah_comma_ I have it plugged into my computer.  I cant tell you_comma_ or even begin to explain_comma_ how real everything feels when you use it.	0 
How much do they go for?	0 
It was $400_comma_ having a computer that can run it is the expensive piece	0 
thats not bad. I have a rx 280 	1 
I had to help my dad move some heavy stuff around this past weekend.	0 
Moving_comma_ is always such a pain. Did it go smoothly at least?	0 
Yeah.  He kept up with me pretty well.	0 
That's good_comma_ glad he wasn't having too tough a time.	1 
my neighbor dog is always barking_comma_ I can't stand it	0 
Oh man_comma_ I can't stand barking dogs. I wish owners would do something to shut them up. 	0 
i know the worst part is my bedroom is near the fence and the dog barks all night 	0 
That can make it so hard to sleep at night. 	1 
When I was a little girl my favorite childhood character was Strawberry Shortcake. I miss those days smelling my little figurines that smelled like strawberries.	0 
Aw man_comma_ childhood is full of good memories! I love the smell of strawberries. 	0 
Yeah_comma_ I also remember having my strawberry shortcake themed birthday party. There were strawberries everywhere! I bet you could guess what flavor the cake and ice cream were_comma_ lol.	0 
Haha_comma_ clearly strawberry. Sounds like you had an enjoyable childhood! 	1 
my neighbor dog barks all day_comma_ I like to go over there and tell him where he can put that dog at_comma_	0 
Your neighbor doesn't do anything about his dogs?	0 
that is the problem_comma_ he does nothing_comma_ except give me his little mustache smile_comma_ one of these days i'll wipe that smile off his face	0 
If it were me_comma_ I'd call the animal shelter and report possible abuse since the dog does nothing but bark all day - poor thing just needs attention and the owner isn't taking care of it.	1 
I feel so sad to see the world in the state that it is in but I am confident that times are changing and humanity is actually good.	0 
Really depends on the person I think. You can't have good people without bad people.	0 
Yes that is true. The ying and the yang. But I think most people are good though.	0 
Agreed!	1 
My childhood was great. I have mainly positive memories of it.	0 
You are very lucky my friend. There are so many children out there that cannot say the same_comma_ sadly. But so happy for you!	0 
Yeah life ends up pretty dark for tons of people. It's slightly absurd when you think far into it!	0 
I guess it all comes down to karma_comma_ if you believe in that stuff...... I do. :)	1 
I decided to try and get some projects knocked out a couple of nights ago_comma_ but needed to keep my kids occupied.	0 
what did you end up doing?	0 
Luckily_comma_ my wife was willing to keep them busy.  Even after she had a crazy day!	0 
It's good to have a partner. 	1 
My wife took the kids over to her mother's one evening before I got home from work.  I thought it'd be pretty nice to have a quiet house for once.	0 
I have a son_comma_ it's definitely nice to have some peace and quiet.	0 
It was for a while_comma_ but it was too quiet for me!  I've gotten used to the noise.	0 
You must have been very happy when they returned home.	1 
I tried for a promotion at work recently.  It's been a while since I've gotten a raise_comma_ so I worked pretty hard at it.	0 
Did you get it?	0 
No_comma_ they ended up giving it to someone with less experience.	0 
That's disappointing. I feel sorry for you. 	1 
I went to the casino with my brother and the only thing he could do was win! The only thing I could do was lose.	0 
That sounds like a bummer. Hopefully_comma_ you did not lose too much.	0 
Nope_comma_ I'm a little careful when I go out there.  It would have been nice to join in on the winning though!	0 
Yeah_comma_ but it is a good thing to hear you did not lose too much. Some people put all the money on the line.	1 
I interviewed for a job.  I know I gave great answers to their questions and walked away feeling like the job was mine.	0 
Hey_comma_ that's awesome! I hope you get it. When do you hear?	0 
Probably next week sometime. I'm really excited!	0 
Well I hope you do. What kind of job is it?	1 
I work in tech support.  One issue I was given the details before and got to do research before I worked with the customer.  It was great knowing what to do before it happened.	0 
You must have been relieved you were able to help. Did all go as plan?	0 
yeah! I pretty much knew all the steps that I needed to do before everything started and there werent any surprise issues which was awesome.	0 
That's awesome! I'm glad it went through without a hitch!	1 
my girlfriend just got promoted at her job. I am really glad for her.	0 
Oh_comma_ that's terrific! What a great feeling that is_comma_ to be appreciated and valued!	0 
i knew she could and would get the promotion_comma_ i feel like i am going to burst 	0 
Oh_comma_ I love that you are so happy for her! You sound like such a supportive and loving partner!	1 
I have been working on potty training my dog and she has been doing great! Last night though she went a TON in the house right after I brought her out.	0 
I also have two older puppies_comma_ training takes time and care and love.	0 
It definitely does!  I have one older puppy that I got through potty training.  This one is just taking a little extra time.	0 
Puppies are smart believe it or not_comma_ use treats and don't yell or punish for their mistakes. A change of tone and placing them outside works really well.	1 
I was packing up things to move from my girlfriends house and found her son's lite brite.  It reminded me of my childhood and playing with that toy.	0 
i remember the lite brite toy. it was a nice toy to have.	0 
It really was! The toys back then seemed to have lasted a lot longer than the toys now too!	0 
i agree_comma_ the toys now days are made cheaply and of poor quality. everything is about video games. 	1 
I had a move a couple weekends ago.  I was really planning on getting everything done_comma_ or at least moved over_comma_ in one weekend.	0 
Moving can be stressful for sure_comma_ hopefully you had some help?	0 
yeah_comma_ the help was great and we did end up getting everything over.  Now the fun part is unpacking the boxes!	0 
It's like christmas! only you already know whats in the boxes. the best part about moving is you can have a fresh start on organization. 	1 
I had a great weekend with my son_comma_ we did a ton of fun things.  At the end of the weekend his attitude changed and he didnt want to listen at all.	0 
That's not good!  What did you do to try to get him to listen again?	0 
I made a deal that if he went to bed he would get tablet time the next day and if he didnt then he wouldnt get any time	0 
I bet that worked!	1 
My dog went number 2 in the middle of the night inside.  The next morning she threw up everything...it was the worst smelling pile of stuff I've ever smelled.	0 
Oh man_comma_ i'm about to eat dinner over here! lol that's pretty gross. My cat pukes up stuff all the time so i can kind of relate.	0 
Sorry about that! Yeah_comma_ it was a terrible thing to wake up to!	0 
I bet_comma_ hope the dog is feeling better though.	1 
I used to have a boxer puppy that was so sweet and adorable.  HOwever he had on issue that I could not stand.	0 
interesting_comma_ what was the issue?	0 
Well when he was during the potty training stage he would often poop on the floor.   HOwever he would then eat it!!!!!   I could smell it but not find it anywhere.   He would come running into the living room wanting to lick you on the face with poop breath!	0 
oh man_comma_ that is an issue_comma_ i hope he grows out of it	1 
next week my vacation starts. I am really looking forward to it	0 
I bet you cant wait.  WHere are going for your vacation?	0 
i always wanted to visit Miami_comma_ i can't wait to visit the beach and take in all  the fun	0 
Miami sounds like a great place to go for a vacation.   I wish I was going with you!	1 
One of my coworkers was outright belligerent today.	0 
That sucks! What were they upset about?	0 
I don't even know!  She does that sometimes_comma_ and just badgers you.  I can't figure out what fires her up.	0 
It sounds like a very challenging environment to work in.	1 
My girlfriend is moving in.  I was pretty calm when we first started talking about it.  I'm really excited but there is so much to pack up!	0 
That's exciting! When will she be moving in?	0 
In 2 weeks.  It'll come up fast_comma_ I think thats why I'm starting to get a little more nervous.  Its not even her_comma_ its just the move that will not be fun	0 
Does she live far away?	1 
My wife and I are trying to build a house_comma_ and keep running into delays getting the permits.	0 
That sounds very frustrating.	0 
It is!  The guy at the city could care less if he helps us out.	0 
Hopefully you'll able to get it all sorted out soon.  I'm sure when it's done it'll be a beautiful house.	1 
I was home alone last night playing a VR game.  It took a really creepy turn that I really wasnt expecting at all.	0 
What happened?	0 
It was a duck hunting game and all of a sudden the dog from the game killed my mom and started coming after me.  I dont know if you've ever tried VR but everything feels SO real.  It was pretty scary	0 
I've never tried VR_comma_ but just imagining that is scaring me away from it.	1 
a job I applied and interview for a couple of months ago offered me the job. It was unexpected.	0 
Congrats!  How exciting for you.	0 
thank you_comma_ when they called_comma_ I did not know who it was at first_comma_ then it was_comma_ wow I got the job	0 
That's a long time to hold out hope.  I bet you were shocked.	1 
My husband_comma_ I think you've met him_comma_ he's been having a hard time finding a job recently. He's been in the final two candidates THREE times but no luck!	0 
It always takes time. Hang in there It will all work out.	0 
Well_comma_ he's got another interview on Thursday. I just know he will get that one!	0 
I bet so too!  Good luck to you both.	1 
i needed help with choosing a subject to major and my brother helped	0 
What subject did you choose?	0 
I chose finance and economics	0 
Nice choice. I guess you have good relationship with your brother.	1 
I felt ashamed seeing the police officer yelling at the old lady	0 
why was the officer yelling at her?	0 
She was trying to cross the road and accidentally had her phone fall_comma_ the officer thought she was insane	0 
wow_comma_ that's unfortunate. i would feel embarrassed for the lady	1 
My mother has been a caring mom since i got ill a week ago	0 
That's so wonderful. I love being cared for when I am ill.	0 
Yah_comma_ i feel loved so much	0 
It is an amazing thing to have a loving mother. Everyone should show more appreciation to their moms.	1 
I had to walk home from work last night after I got off late at night_comma_ it was kind of scary.	0 
Sorry about that_comma_ you could have taken a taxi	0 
It was a short enough walk_comma_ I just stayed aware of my surroundings and got home safe.	0 
good enough you got home safe	1 
Today I was looking through my childhood photos and writings_comma_ it made me a little emotional and nostalgic.	0 
Did you have a good childhood? You must miss a lot of things.	0 
I think I had a good childhood. I love that I have many photos that I ca look back on.	0 
Yes. Nostalgia is unavoidable when we look back on our youth.	1 
I slept through a really important class because I was hungover and I failed because of it. I should've behaved better.	0 
That's unfortunate. But at least you learned from the experience_comma_ right?	0 
I sure did. I am just embarrassed that I did that_comma_ I am not usually that way. It was out of character for me.	0 
No need to feel ashamed. We all make mistakes and at least you learned your lesson.	1 
I had to care for my younger brother last week while he was sick. I tried my best to make him as comfortable as possible. 	0 
That's nice that you helped him. I'm sure he appreciated it!	0 
He did_comma_ he is nice and well now. I just know how horrible it is to be sick_comma_ it helps to have someone to care for you.	0 
Yes_comma_ it really does. I am sure if you get sick_comma_ he will remember and do the same for you!	1 
I once got in a really bad accident on my way home from work and it really upset me	0 
Wow! Were you hurt? Was anyone else hurt?	0 
luckily the only problem I had was my neck was sore for a few weeks but nobody else was hurt	0 
That's good news at least. I hope you are feeling better now. And don't be hard on yourself_comma_ accidents happen.	1 
Hi! I had a great day with my emotions with my child going to school!	0 
Oh that's great_comma_ its awesome when the kids go off to school each year.	0 
Yes - this is m child's first year and it was pretty difficult for me to let someone take care of him instead of me. You know how it is! Parent life.	0 
You'll get used to it and begin to appreciate your quiet time_comma_ haha.	0 
Yes!  I'm already enjoying it!  How are you doing?	1 
I just had a weird experience at Wal-Mart today!	0 
Wal-Mart is a place where weirdness always happens. Can you tell me what happened_comma_ I'm dying to know!	0 
Well_comma_ I was parked pretty close and a guy came up to ask me for gas money!  There was a gas station a small walk away though!	0 
Do you think he was panhandling you for money or a person who really needed it? Did you give him money?	0 
I didn't have any cash on me.  He got out of a vehicle that had two other guys in it...staring at me!	1 
I'm going to cut to the chase here. Just blurt it on. My DRESS blew up in front of parents and children the other day when it was windy.	0 
That must have been a very windy day!	0 
I wanted to run and hide.  I haven't' worn a dress since.  	0 
I bet It will teach you.	0 
Oh it did.  I learned my lesson.	1 
i felt great last year when i started going to church again	0 
I go to church every Sunday I love it.	0 
yeah its a great feeling getting back into church !	0 
The people you can meet are super.	1 
I felt very grateful last week when an elderly women paid for my gas 	0 
That	0 
Yeah its nice when people do kind things like this it doesn't happen very often now day	0 
That is really not thing. I wish more people would do such nice thing. I know that made your day.	1 
When I lived on my own_comma_ I found it hard without having any company	0 
So you don't like to be alone. I am so sorry that affects you. So what would you do? 	0 
I was used to having family or friends around most of the time in my old place_comma_ but then I moved away. I had to make new friends which I found very difficult	0 
Yes_comma_ usually when one relocates it's hard to make new friends_comma_ but eventually it will happen.	0 
I eventually made friends through work_comma_ and it is really nice when my old friends come to visit too 	0 
That was really nice of your old friends.	1 
I love the gifts that i received last week on my birthday	0 
Happy birthday. What was your favorite gift?	0 
A pair of shoe	0 
Nice. What brand of shoes were they?	1 
I felt a bit sad last week when i saw an elderly man drop his wallet and a kid picked it up and didn't give it back to the man	0 
That's terrible. Were you able to identify the kid?	0 
Yeah eventually the kid was caught i told the man and he caught him shortly after	0 
I'm glad he was able to catch him.	1 
I saw the movie trailer about Paul Walker's life today. It made me so sad!	0 
Wow_comma_ how was it? I have never seen that trailer. 	0 
It was just sad. I love Paul Walker and his movies. I still remember hearing about him passing away in the same way he became famous. In a fast car.	0 
Aww_comma_ that is so sad to hear. He must have made some great movies! 	0 
Oh he did!  I think the one about candy cane and the truck driver was my favorite. I can't remember the name.	1 
Speaking of babies_comma_ I got to meet my nephews yesterday!	0 
Are they twins?!	0 
Yes!  They are so sweet. I don't even like kids and I really felt my heart warm up to them.	0 
Awww! Twins seem like a handful but also very exciting at the same time!	1 
The other day something happened that made me want to run and hide.	0 
Oh_comma_ I'm sorry. What happened?	0 
It didn't happen to me directly_comma_ but my husband passed GAS while we were shopping. Everyone was staring.	0 
I can imagine that you did want to run and hide. Sometimes husbands get us into all kinds of situations.	1 
My girlfriend and I were watching a series on Netflix.  She wasnt home and I ended up watching a couple episodes ahead of where we were at.	0 
I've been in that situation before. Did she find out about it? 	0 
She didnt say anything but I think she knew.  I mean_comma_ I still watched the episodes that she missed with her!	0 
Well that's all that matters. If she was okay with it. I'm sure she was happy watching the episodes with you_comma_ even if you had already watched them. 	1 
I moved last weekend.  I was really happy once everything was done and it went smoothly.	0 
That sounds like a bit of work. Are you adjusting to your place now?	0 
Yeah_comma_ unpacking and all that fun stuff now.  I really like the new place though.	0 
That's what's most important. I'm glad everything has gone well.	1 
I'm not in a good mood! My husband got to go to a basketball game. I wish I could have too!	0 
Oh_comma_ I'm sorry. Why didn't you get to go with him?	0 
I have to stay home with our son.  It is hard for us to find a baby sitter for him.	0 
Oh_comma_ that's too bad. I know exactly how you feel. Hopefully your husband will watch your son another night so you can go have some fun. 	1 
I went to a friend's wedding this weekend!	0 
Was it a lot of fun?	0 
Oh gosh yes. I wore a beautiful dress. I felt so pretty!	0 
That's great_comma_ but you don't have to wear a fancy dress to be beautiful. I'm sure you're gorgeous no matter what you wear!	0 
Thank you! I feel like a slob lately.	0 
It's ok_comma_ just try your best to remind yourself how beautiful you are and practice self-care as a habit.	1 
it is nice to have a loving pet _comma_ My dog is always there for me	0 
What a great feeling! You must love your dog.	0 
i really do_comma_ no matter what happens_comma_ she will always be by my side	0 
She sounds like a great companion.	1 
Hello! I started my graduate classes today.	0 
Are you looking forward to it?	0 
Yes. I have all my binders ready with paper and a calendar to keep track of stuff.  I'm nervous but ready!	0 
Exciting! I'm sure you'll do fine.	0 
I hope so!  It's very different from undergraduate	1 
I really need to change doctors!	0 
Why is that?	0 
He keeps screwing up my prescription!  I've needed it for a week now but they keep sending it to the wrong place or use the wrong name	0 
Wow_comma_ that's no good. I hope they get it worked out soon.	0 
Me too.  	1 
I was playing a VR game home alone.  It took a really creepy turn towards the end of the game.	0 
I can't play those kinds of games. Too spooky for me.	0 
It didnt start off scary but out of nowhere everyone around me was dying and I was home alone with a killer outside the house.  It all just feels so real in VR too.	0 
That would keep me up at night.	1 
yesterday i ate a whole big bag of M&Ms_comma_ i don't feel proud of myself	0 
Oh my gosh that's insane. Well_comma_ I'm sure you'll be able to control your impulses in the future. 	0 
i hope so_comma_ i was doing so well on my diet but I feel like I failed	0 
I've been there before too. The important thing to remember is that there is always another chance to make it right tomorrow. 	1 
We recently got a new puppy. My older dog waits his turn and knows the puppy should go outside to the bathroom first.	0 
Aww_comma_ sounds like he is teaching the puppy. That's so sweet.	0 
It is pretty awesome!  I'm impressed that he knows he doesnt need to be first and the puppy should have priority.	0 
Yeah_comma_ sounds like a pretty smart pup.	1 
We've been really struggling with potty training my son.	0 
I do understand_comma_ I have a son myself. You just need to be patient and continue trying.	0 
Thanks_comma_ we are.  He did finally go #2 in the toilet by himself last night_comma_ though!	0 
That is awesome. I am proud of him 	1 
I went out with some friends a couple weekends ago and we met a group of girls. One asked for my number but I told her I have a girlfriend and didnt give it out.	0 
gotta risk it for the biscuit	0 
Haha_comma_ I dont think I could do that to my girlfriend.  I like her too much for a random chick.	0 
 i feel ya but sometimes temptation is good gets the heart pumping	1 
i have a presentation due this week_comma_ I am not looking forward to presenting it in front of others	0 
It can be nerve wrecking. I'm sure you will do fine_comma_ though! Have confidence!	0 
i feel like i know the material but i am not sure if i can pull it off in front of others	0 
You know they say_comma_ imagine them in their underwear...I wonder that really works. I'm not fond of public speaking either.	1 
I felt very bad when my boss did not approve of my work. It just makes me more motivated to work harder.	0 
Did you spend a lot of the time on the project?	0 
Yes_comma_ I feel like I worked really hard and I put in so many hours. I guess it was not good enough. :(	0 
I wouldnt get discouraged.  Maybe talk to your boss and see what you can improve on next time.  I'm sure_comma_ at least if you have a good boss_comma_ they will want you to succeed and guide you in how to do better.	0 
Thank you for your great advice my friend!	1 
My roommate moved out and soon my girlfriend will move in but right now it is just me in the house. I dont remember the last time I lived without any roommates.	0 
Nice! Enjoy it! I like living alone. It is so peaceful! I get lonely somtimes but for the most part it is great!	0 
It does feel a little lonely.  It's weird coming home and not really having someone to talk to in person.	0 
Yeah_comma_ but they are all just a phone call away. Keep your head up_comma_ your girlfriend will be there soon!	1 
I feel so happy when the sunsets are beautiful and I can take the time to watch and relax. It is the best time of the day for me.	0 
Oh I know_comma_ mine too! I love how all the colors change with the setting sun.	0 
Yeah_comma_ it is such a good time to reflect and meditate on life and stop to enjoy the beauty of this world.	0 
It reminds you of how beautiful life is.	1 
Man the new guys at work were slandering our boss so bad.	0 
Wow_comma_ that's rude! He won't last long...	0 
I know right?  I made sure to keep my mouth shut and not add on to what they were saying or doing.	0 
Yeah_comma_ some nerve on that guy. He should be grateful to have a job!	1 
My sister is having another baby! I can't wait to meet her! This will be her fourth child.	0 
Oh wow! Congrats!! How exciting!! How far along is she?	0 
Only one more month to go. She is about the explode though! Glad it is her and not me_comma_ lol.	0 
LOL Right!!! It's way too hot to be pregnant right now!	0 
Totally agree! But I will be there to fan my sister for her at least. Haha	0 
You are so awesome!!! I wish I had  sister like you when I was pregnant.	1 
There was a random dog in my yard yesterday morning.  He didn't look mean but I wasn't sure I wanted to mess with him.	0 
I've been in that situation before!  It can be scary	0 
It was!  I didn't want to chase him off either.  Thankfully he just kind of wandered away.	0 
I'm glad it worked out in the end!  I wish people would be more careful with their dogs.	1 
I bought something from the store and the lady gave me the wrong change. She gave me too much change actually. I did not realize until later after I left the store.	0 
Oh_comma_ no. Did you take it back or keep it	0 
I have not had time to go back yet but I will for sure. I feel bad like as if I did something wrong. I better check my change from now on.	0 
The store might not take it back at this point if it has been to long. 	1 
So I was driving down the road the other day and passed that stretch of road that has all those mimosa trees.  They were in bloom and man did they stir up some emotions.	0 
That sounds beautiful! What emotions did they bring out of you?	0 
My grandmother kept those trees at our old house.  They super made me miss her and when we used to sit outside on her porch.	0 
I'm sorry! What a lovely memory to have of her though. It's good to still have things in your life that remind you of her.	1 
So I lost the ring that my best friend gave me when he moved out of country.  We had matching ones made and it's really breaking my heart.	0 
Oh no! That's so sad. I'm so sorry_comma_ I know you must feel like crap.	0 
It's strange sometimes how we get so attached to material things like this.  I know I really shouldn't but it feels like a piece of me is gone.	0 
I understand completely. I have things of my grandfather's that I can never replace.	1 
We had a pretty fun family vacation about a month ago.	0 
Sweet! Where did you go?	0 
We went to a lake not far from here.  We had a ton of fun on the boat . . . nobody else was on the water one of the days!	0 
That would be awesome to have the whole lake to yourself! My guess is the weather was nice too if you guys got to use the boat most days!	1 
I work in tech support.  Every once in a while a customer will want our software to do something it either cant or is not built for.	0 
I've had similar experiences.  What do you end up doing?	0 
I write up feedback for development. It just gets frustrating when they start to demand that I fix it.  I might be good at my job but not good enough to do a code change on the fly.	0 
Have you ever had a positive experience from that cycle?	1 
I had to take my dog to the vet yesterday and I had full confidence they would take care of his problems. They are so good there.	0 
oh no! hope all is well with your dog.	0 
Thank you. Other than an allergic reaction and a subsequent skin infection all is well. Just a couple weeks of meds and a change in diet needed.	0 
Good to read. Always great to find a vet you can trust. Looks like you did. 	1 
So we went out to that new BBQ place to eat the other night.  	0 
BBQ sounds so good right now! How was it?	0 
It wasn't bad.  It wasn't earth shattering good either.  Everything just weirdly seemed okay.  It was a bit strange. 	0 
Well that's kind of disappointing. It's always a let down when you go out and it isn't is good as you were hoping.	1 
I really loathe meetings.  They're usually so pointless.	0 
i completely agree. though_comma_ i'm remote so i am never sitting in the same room as others so i can distract myself ;)	0 
That must be nice . . . I'm in person.  However_comma_ I actually had a productive meeting this morning.  How novel that was!	0 
lol. it kinda is. i moved about 3 hours south of my office a few years ago and since even at the office my work involves connecting to remote data centers it hasn't changed my job any. 	1 
Oh man.  I was at the store yesterday and my nose just started bleeding like crazy!	0 
That's terrible! What did you do?	0 
I had to bolt out of the store!  I have never been so embarrassed.  Lucky for me I had a napkin in my purse so I didn't get it everywhere.	0 
That's good. I'm glad your alright.	1 
Once in Kindergarten_comma_ a pair of my underwear got stuck in my shirt and fell out in the middle of the classroom.	0 
Oh no! That's so sad. You must've been so upset. 	0 
I was! I thought I was going to get in trouble	0 
Hopefully you didn't and hopefully the other kids didn't make fun of you	1 
the other day I was looking at old pictures of a car i use to own. I miss that car.	0 
What kind of car was it?	0 
i was an old Cadillac_comma_ reason I miss it_comma_ lot of memories of family and friends riding in it	0 
Oh I bet! My husband wants an older car when we can afford it	1 
i just lost my pet dog. I do not know what to do.	0 
OH NO! I would be devastated. Did he pass_comma_ or missing?	0 
i cannot find her anywhere_comma_ she is missing_comma_ it feels like I have a part of me missing 	0 
I am so sorry. I am sure you are. I would be devastated if I was in your shoes. Does she have a chip? Maybe someone will get her to a vet office.	1 
It was wonderful not having to worry about my most recent exam_comma_ knowing I was prepared.	0 
Good job! How do you think you did on it?	0 
I know I did well! I studied and felt very prepared when I took it.	0 
That is a good feeling. Time to celebrate before the grind starts all over!	1 
I packed for a long road trip_comma_ and had everything I would need to hopefully avoid excessive stops. 	0 
Yeah I like going straight to the point too	0 
Definitely. Nothing worse than dragging out a drive because you didn't pack enough food and didn't plan bathroom breaks.	0 
I like when I get places earlier than expected	1 
I had a dentist appointment yesterday.  I hate going to the dentist!	0 
I understand that completely! Did you have to get any work done?	0 
Yes I had to get a filling in my very back tooth.  THe dentist said I had a very deep cavity and to raise my hand if I started to feel anything because it was very close to my nerve.   I was scared the whole time.	0 
That sounds scary! I always avoid going to the dentist until I absolutely have to. I know that's pretty bad!	1 
My son wouldnt sleep last night.  He kept yelling and wouldnt go into his room.	0 
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Was he afraid or just didn't want to sleep?	0 
He just didnt want to sleep. I think he was overtired and trying to fight it at that point.	0 
Ugh_comma_ that's the worst. That happens a lot with my son as well. Hopefully he wasn't too cranky today!	1 
My son graduated pre-school.  It isnt much but its that next step in his school career.	0 
That is wonderful! You must be happy_comma_ shows that he is getting bigger_comma_ soon it will be college 	0 
Haha_comma_ I hope not too soon!  I was really happy_comma_ he is growing pretty fast!	0 
College is when the tear will start to flow. I love children.	1 
I'm going to a beer dabbler this weekend.  It has been very busy the last couple weeks so I'm really looking forward to drinking and relaxing this weekend.	0 
That will be fun. What a great way to relax and unwind	0 
I think so.  I'm hoping the weather will be nice and we can all have a great time!	0 
I saw the weather forecast. We only have a 20% chance of rain so you know how it is here. We'll be good.	1 
I'm trying to transition my dog into not sleeping in my room.  I know he wants to be by me and I can hear him whining and scratching at the door some nights	0 
That must be hard to do_comma_ he wants to be beside you. He is going to miss you.	0 
I know.  It's tough to hear but he needs to be a little more independent and sleep in his own bed too!	0 
Yes he needs to so you would have to ignore him at nights.	1 
i do love my pet doggy_comma_ she is a treat to have	0 
That is so sweet. What is her name?	0 
Angie_comma_ i like to give her a warm bath_comma_ dress her in her doggy clothes and give her a doggy treat	0 
I can just imagine she sleeps in your bed sometimes. I love dogs_comma_ I would like to have a dog someday.	1 
We just got a new puppy.  My older dog knew to let that one out first when I got home from work.	0 
That is very cute_comma_ the little one probably couldn't hold its bladder as long. 	0 
Definitely not.  I was surprised that he knew to let the little one go first!	0 
That was very smart of him_comma_ maybe he remembers back to his puppy days.	1 
I used to have my dog in his crate when I left for work.  Lately I have been letting him out more and more in the house when I've been gone.	0 
That's good. How is it going?	0 
It's going well!  So far no accidents and he doesnt appear to have ruined anything.	0 
That's great news! It sounds like he is enjoying his new freedom_comma_ and was ready for it. 	1 
I was driving down the road and I almost hit a dog! I was so close. Really scary!	0 
I'm glad you didn't hit the dog!  Did he jump out at you suddenly?	0 
Yes_comma_ he came out of nowhere and I slammed on my brakes. My tires skid across the road.	0 
I live out in a rural area where people don't always have control of their dogs.  Sometimes those little ankle-biting dogs will start chasing the car and they make a break for the car and it makes one really fearful that you'll hit them.	1 
I finished all the ice cream when I was told to leave some for others. I was just so hungry!	0 
lol_comma_ guess you were pretty hungry	0 
Yeah_comma_ now I am scared somebody will find out. I better go buy some more before anyone gets home. Haha	0 
yeah_comma_ might wanna go replace it	1 
I am the happiest in my life when I am at the ocean. There is just something so special about nature at the ocean for me.	0 
That sounds amazing. What's your favorite beach to go to?	0 
I don't really have a favorite. They are all my favorite! But I prefer the beaches that have perfect soft sand with no rocks or anything. Like a huge swimming pool! 	0 
Those are the best. Especially the white sand crystal clear water beaches.	1 
I saw Dubai from the airplane one day. I never went into the city_comma_ but wow_comma_ it was a sight to see!	0 
i sure it was beautiful	0 
It looked like another planet or something. Very sci-fi. Almost scary actually.	0 
really_comma_ i wouldve never thought that. i have a friend who is in Dubai on a teaching assignment	1 
I found out that my neighbors eat turtle meat. How gross!!!	0 
yuck_comma_ how gross!!	0 
Yeah_comma_ who does that? I have three pet turtles so I better keep a good watch on them. lol	0 
lol right_comma_ they could easily be your neighbors dinner	1 
I felt very sad recently when i found out that my mother has cancer 	0 
Oh my gosh_comma_ I am so sorry for your family.	0 
Thank you .  Shes a fighter i hope she can push through 	0 
I'm sure she can with all the technology and modern medicine now. She's got this!!	1 
I don't have many friends and my family lives very far away. I sometimes feel very sad.	0 
why do you live so far from family	0 
It is just where I ended up in life. You know one thing leads to another and your living a whole knew life.	0 
i would like a new life. i totally understand	1 
I heard a really loud bang in the middle of the night. the next morning I found out that it was gun shots. OMG	0 
what? that scary	0 
Someone was grabbed from their home and brought out to the street and was shot in the foot. Guess they wanted to teach him a lesson.	0 
wow_comma_ a hard lesson	1 
My internet connection keeps breaking! How am I going to get all my work done?	0 
I understand!  I live in the country and have the same problem.	0 
It always happens when there are electrical storms. It seems to be storm season around here.	0 
Yes.  The only company available out here is Century Link and they just crash randomly all the time.	1 
I feel very blessed that I have been able to live around the world my whole life. Now I am settled in one place for awhile.	0 
That is very cool. What took you all around the world? What was your favourite place?	0 
My father was in the military so I lived all over the world my first 20 years of life. My favorite place is Spain.	0 
What interesting stories you must have! I think that would be really neat_comma_ but settling down is probably good too. 	1 
My guinea pig had 5 babies but all of them died. I don't know why...	0 
That is so sad.  I hate it when pets die.	0 
Yeah_comma_ it is terrible. I just wish I knew why but oh well. She will have more babies in a couple months. 	0 
yes.  they do like to have lots of  babies	1 
Hello!	0 
I am going on a trip to Peru to visit Machu Picchu! I can't sleep because of the anticipation!	0 
WOW im so jealous! You lucky dog.	0 
I hear it is a very spiritual place to be and full of beauty and history.	0 
I have heard the same. Are you going with anyone else?	0 
Yes_comma_ my friends are coming with me. :)	0 
I want to be your friend!	1 
I just got cable installed in my new house_comma_ I was so excited waiting for the cable guy to come!	0 
Congrats! Did you do it because of football season?	0 
I honestly do not really watch football but I most excited to catch up on some of my favorite TV shows.	0 
Cool! Whats your favoirite? I like the office.	0 
Right now I am really enjoying Mr. Robot. I've never seen The Office but I always hear wonderful things about it.	0 
I have never heard of Mr. Robot actually.	1

Same here! I am glad you are doing well! :)	0 
i am glad you are doing well also. I like my job and i have a loving family_comma_ no complaints here.	0 
I hope these feelings last for you!	1 
My dog just had a baby and I did not even know she was pregnant! What!!	0 
A puppy!  That's so exciting!  Are you going to keep it?	0 
I am not sure yet. I already have 4 dogs. I want to because he is so cute!	0 
I don't know that I would be able to give it up.  4 is a lot_comma_ but what's one more?	0 
Yeah_comma_ lol true!	1 
My boyfriend is going out with a bunch of people I don't know tonight. But I trust him that he will be a good boy.	0 
Well I'm sure he will be_comma_ most guys are. I'd never get to  do anything if my girlfriend didn't trust me.	0 
Yeah. I was in a bad relationship before with a man that was extremely untrustworthy so sometimes I get a bit crazy sometimes. 	0 
Everyone gets jealous_comma_ It when you act on unfounded stuff that is the issue.	1 
I get so upset when someone does not agree with what I am doing. I am a grown women and feel I can make good choices for myself.	0 
Yes sometimes people do stick their noses in where they do not belong	0 
Yes_comma_ it is like they don't have a life of their own and want to control others lives. 	0 
Yes.  Especially men who want to mansplain things to you.	1 
By brother won a scratch off sticker lottery ticket! He is giving most of it to charity.	0 
Wow!  How much did he win?	0 
He won like $40_comma_000. He is a good man to give it all away to a good cause.	0 
That is awesome that he gave it away!  Maybe good karma will let him win again.	1 
I was driving the other day and my gas tank was super low. I thought I could make it to school in time but decided that running out of gas was the bigger problem.	0 
Good choice. You could have broken down and never made it to school.	0 
Yeah so true. The funny thing is as I was driving into the gas station my car started to stall because of having zero gas. lol	0 
HAHA! You are super lucky you are smart. Lol	1 
Very often I get very emotional when things go wrong. I think more emotional than most people.	0 
Everyone handles stress differently. My anxiety gets so High I sometimes cancel my plans.	0 
I know it is not healthy for the body to get so stressed out but I just can't help it. Maybe I need a therapist.	0 
I go to a psychiatrist and take meds_comma_ It just fixes what your body doesn't make_comma_ or do properly. It helps so much. 	1 
I made a stupid mistake at work and I got fired. What am I going to do?	0 
Oh no! It will be ok. It seems everyone in life has to go through that at least once. Everyone gets through it!	0

Sometimes you need those times to make your realize how special having a job is. Gives you perspective.	1

My cousin has the perfect life_comma_ sometimes I am envious of her.	0 
Wonderful I bet she is really content if everything is perfect. Love to hear that someone is doing well.	0

Things like that make me antsy.	1 
After my haircut last week_comma_ I have received so many nice compliments!	0

My aspirations when I was younger. We had a good laugh when I read in one of my old journals that I wanted to be a teacher when earlier that day I had stated that I couldn't imagine being a teacher now.	0 
Haha! Well_comma_ as we mature_comma_ we learn so much more about ourselves.	1

I was so angry_comma_ I had to leave for work very soon. I ended up just asking a neighbor to borrow some. I didn't have anytime to buy any before work. I couldn't afford to be late.	0 
That's nice of your neighbor! Your boyfriend should've told you that there was no toothpaste earlier. Maybe there would've been time to get some. But at least you didn't go to work with stinky breath_comma_ right?	1 
I once had a party when I was a teenager.  My parents were out of town.	0 
Haha everyone has to do that once. Can you tell me a great story about the party?	0 
Sure can!   Of course you cant have a party as a teen without alcohol_comma_ so needless to say we were all drunk.   We attempted to play darts.   Since we were all drunk we missed the board leaving wholes all over the wall.  THe house was trashed when my parents returned.  Years later I feel bad about it still.	0 
Hahaha thats funny. I hope you guys are still on good terms. To be honest little holes sounds like an easy fix.	1 
i envy my sister_comma_ she is going on vacation in Paris	0 
Wow_comma_ cool. Maybe you can ask to tag along?	0 
I will be at work_comma_ maybe next time	0 
That's too bad. Well_comma_ at least you have something to work towards and plan as a goal for yourself.	1

That's amazing! He probably loves you so much	1 
i was upset at myself for sleeping in so late this morning	0 
Do you feel nice and refreshed though?	0

I did the same thing today_comma_ so you are not alone in your behavior friend!	1 
I dropped my iPod touch on the bathroom floor.	0 
Oh no! Did it break?	0 
Unfortunately yes. The screen shattered and I went for over a month without music.	0 
Oh_comma_ that really stinks. I hope you were able to get another one.	1 
My guinea pig was feeling very sick but I was able to nurse her back to health.	0 
Did you do some neat doctor stuff on it?	0 
No_comma_ I hate giving chemical medicine to my animals. I just kept her on a heating blanket and gave her lots of fresh veggies. She is alright now!	0 
Oh yea that sounds like you did a good job!	1 
After training my dog I feel confident now that he can be around others dogs without fighting.	0 
That is good_comma_ how long did it take before you go him to this point?	0 
It took about a month. I think it was quicker but I was just too nervous to bring him around others dogs to find out.	0 
Yeah i understand_comma_ it is good that you took him there though	1

Wow they must be doing well. Why dont you try to get one?	0 
really cannot afford one_comma_ but the neighbor can_comma_ he is always buying expensive stuff_comma_ last month he bought a speed boat.	0 
sounds wasteful to me. life isnt about material things anyway. 	1 
Last week I had a argument with my son_comma_ he really said some mean things to me. I thought I raised him better.	0 
Yeah sometimes kids say things that they really dont mean in the heat of the momment	0 
It really hurt my feelings. I wish he would've handled it better. I'm more disappointed in him lashing out rather than what he said.	0 
well maybe you guys should talk	0 
I told him I was disappointed in his actions_comma_ but I still love him. We all make mistakes.	1 
My roommate cooked some really foul smelling meat last night_comma_ I had to leave or I was going to puke.	0 
Ugh my neighbors do that sometimes. It's the worst! I think some things should not be allowed to be cooked unless you live alone.	0 
Exactly! I had to air out the place for a couple hours after.	0 
Ick. Hopefully the smell is fully gone now	1 
I used the restroom at a nice restaurant and I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe and didn't know it until I left. 	0 
Oh that is the worst feeling! I hate using the restroom in public as is. 	0 
Yeah_comma_ I wish someone told me at least. They all probably just laughed. Haha	0 
Maybe.  For me I just don't want to cause a stranger to be embarassed lol	1 
I am probably one of the few people in the world that looks forward to winter coming.	0 
I am with you_comma_ i like it a lot more than summer personally	0 
I can get so much work done indoor and the beauty outside is wonderful. I love winter clothes and all the winter holidays.	0 
I feel that_comma_ I hate being hot. In the winter I can be comfy and I can always just put on a jacket if I get too cold_comma_ but in the summer it is not that easy.	1 
When you took your driver's test were you nervous?	0 
I was very nervous. I did not know if I would pass or not.	0 
I took mine last summer I was nervous also. My heat was racing the whole time. I was so anxious!	0 
Did you pass the test?	1 
Sometimes I feel envious of those that have money than I do.	0 
I am the same way_comma_ I barely make anything compared to a lot of people I know	0 
Yeah_comma_ and it seems so hard to make money these days_comma_ at least for me. Maybe I should move to the city where there are more opportunities.	0 
I think cities are more expensive_comma_ like living costs_comma_ so I do not want to live there ether personally	0 
Yeah_comma_ you are right my friend. :)	1 
i believed my friend would return my cell phone to me in time	0 
I'm assuming that he/she didn't return it in time. I'm sorry.	0 
i accidentally left it at his house and had to message him on facebook and ask him if he could drive it over	0 
Oh_comma_ I understand. Did it bring it to you at all?	1

at least your ok_comma_ thank god for that	1 
there is an upcoming promotion at my job_comma_ I am sure i'm going to get it.	0

That's pretty great_comma_ you must really take the initiative.  Good job	1 
I have all my ingredients for my dinner party and now I am getting ready to prepare a feast!	0 
You're much braver than me. I would never host a dinner party.. don't feel like I'm good at planning_comma_ and don't feel like I'm interesting enough to talk to a bunch of different people.	0 
Yeah_comma_ we all have different personalities. But you would come to a dinner party if invited_comma_ right?	0 
I think_comma_ maybe_comma_ yeah! It depends on who's there_comma_ and if I felt comfortable with the host. If I felt like I had enough people to kind of "rescue me" and who I could talk to at the party if I got anxious and couldn't talk to strangers_comma_ then that'd be alright. Other than that_comma_ I just kind of do like maybe a group of 4_comma_ max	1 
I broke one of my mom's crystal figurine_comma_ I tried hard not to tell her but in the end I felt so bad I had to tell her.	0 
Aw_comma_ that's too bad. You did the right thing by telling her though.	0 
Yes_comma_ she didn't even get mad. I still felt so guilty about it though. 	0 
Maybe you could save up and purchase her a new one.	0 
Honestly that is such a wonderful idea!	1 
I feel happy to know that God has got my back and I don't have to worry about anything.	0 
I am right there with you!  God is good and wow_comma_ He's been with me through so much hardship.  I'm so happy you feel the same way.	0 
Oh yes. He is there within all of us and he is the greatest friend we will ever have! He will never let us down. Even when we think He has we should only think it is something that I need to learn and He is so caring that He wants to teach me.	0 
Yes_comma_ we can always count on Him to know the bigger picture and have faith that He's working for our good.  Hope you have a blessed day!	1 
I miss how we all used to celebrate Christmas when I was a child. It was such a warm and cozy time. Things are really changing in this high tech modern world.	0 
They really have changed. I know exactly how you feel and love thinking back to the time.	0 
Yeah_comma_ so you remember all those wonderful old Christmas movies and all those commercials they played in between. I still have some videos of recordings from the 80's. 	0 
Those were awesome! My favorite was the coke commercial at Christmas time. So many memories!	1 
In July_comma_ I found a large moth inside a cottage that my brother and friends were staying at.	0 
Oh fun!  How big was it about?  Did it have neat markings on it?	0 
It was as big as a small bird_comma_ I was super surprised. It was furry and white all over. I caught it with a cup and let it outside so it can live on!	0

That sounds so great!   I hope your plants grow beautifully!	0 
Thanks!! :)	1 
After feeling depressed for days_comma_ I took the time to sit outside in the sun and have a nice chit chat with my mom.	0 
That sounds like the perfect remedy for feeling down. Getting out in the sun and outside the house/bed is so good.  I'm sorry you're struggling with depression.  I understand.	0 
Thank you for your kind words_comma_ it means a lot really. And yeah the cool breeze felt so comforting_comma_ it completely changed my mood!	0 
I am so glad!  You know what to do to help your body and mind and that is good self-care.  I try to do that as well as meditate and pray in the morning.  Really refocuses me.  I'm glad you're feeling better!	1 
There may be a hurricane in my area soon I am kind of scared.	0 
I imagine_comma_ are you prepared for it?	0

i forgot to pay my credit card bill_comma_ I'm so disappointed with myself.	0 
I am sure it'll be ok. Usually if you stay in contact with them and don't blow them off for a long time it will be OK.	0 
Yeah but i am usually so meticulous about those things.  I hope they don't charge an overdraft fee.	0 
I would call them. They usually give you some credit for that.	1 
i have a presentation tomorrow. I am ready for it.	0 
That's good. I assume you have studied hard and are prepared?	0 
for the past two weeks I have bee working on it and this week I have been practicing it 	0 
Good luck! You will do great!	1 
I once called my girlfriend's mother mom by accident.	0 
Haha_comma_ I'm sorry but I had a little laugh at that. It reminded me of the time I did that to my teacher in school. I was embarrassed_comma_ but it made me feel better to find out that it seems like it's a common thing that happens_comma_ since they're female authority figures that you can easily mix up.	0 
Exactly_comma_ especially since we were only dating for a few months! I felt so awkward but she just laughed it off.	0 
Yeah_comma_ she knew what you meant. She probably forgot in two minutes_comma_ while you've thought about it for much longer. The best thing to do there is to just show off your sense of humor and ability to make fun of yourself and not take yourself too seriously_comma_ which it sounds like maybe you did.	1 
The pigeons keep coming into the house a pooping all over the place!	0 
That's gross_comma_ why are they coming in?	0 
Well they are actually my pet pigeons. They are the beautiful white ones with a fan tail. But they sometimes like to come inside to see if they can munch on anything.	0 
You should probably avoid feeding them if you want a clean house.	0 
No better I just put some screen on my windows_comma_ lol.	1 
Oh_comma_ I am so sad that my family could not come and visit me. I miss them all so much. Why is life so busy for everyone these days?	0 
I sure wish it wasn't. I live far from my family and they can't even make time for me to go to them. So I feel for you_comma_ it is very sad.	0 
Family should come first_comma_ right? The people of today are just becoming more isolated and lonely. I wish everyone would wake up!	0 
Absolutely first. Especially when you don't live close.	1 
Recently I had a very good customer service experience with my cable company. Not only did they fix the problem they gifted me free premium content for a year!	0 
I bet it wasn't Comcast! They wouldn't even give you a cup of water for free.	0 
That's so funny! I was so surprised too but really happy. I might even pay for the services when my free year is up.	0 
I am glad you had a nice experience! Its difficult to find such a company that cares about its customers!	1 
My dog eats other animals poop. I have seen them eat goat_comma_ duck and cow poop. I hope they don't get sick.	0 
Oh_comma_ wow! That is crazy_comma_ have you talked to the vet?	0 
The vet says that this can be normal but to make sure that I give them their worm pills regularly. 	0 
I thought it would be normal. Good thing to be cautious. 	1 
Last night there was a terrible thunderstorm. I unplugged all my computers and electronics. Then there was a loud bang and I heard my electrical box make a loud click. I think my house was electrocuted!	0 
Well it is a good thing you unplugged everything!	0

That is a good lesson to learn early_comma_ I am glad everything turned out okay for you!	1

He really did. It made me happy.	1 
The first time my girlfriend invited me to her father's house_comma_ I was super anxious.	0 
Yeah that can be nerve racking! How did it go?	0 
He mostly speaks French_comma_ and although I understand it perfectly I have trouble speaking. In the end it went well_comma_ and he was super easy-going and made me feel like family.	0 
That is good! Are you guys close now>	0 
We are! Every time I come over_comma_ we drink a lot of different beers together. It's how we bond!	1

Good job! Do you feel pretty prepared?	0 
I felt super prepared and I ended up getting the job just last Thursday!	0 
WOWZA! Congrats! Is it a job you can build a career out of.	0 
In a way yes and no. I'm teaching online_comma_ and my major in University is Education at the moment. So it helps me in school_comma_ and looks good on a CV for a full-time teacher position in an actual school someday in the future.	0 
Oh thats good! Thanks for teaching. :)	0 
Thank you for appreciating teachers!	0 
My mom is one so i know how important you guys are.	1

i was channel surfing and ran across the old Batman tv show_comma_ brought back memories.	0 
That is cool! I love flash backs from the past especially when it comes to television. I sometimes watch old shows on youtube that I used to watch as a kid. Love it!	0 
same here_comma_ I loved watching Batman as a kid and could not wait to get home from school to watch it.	0 
I used to watch the Wonder Years after school. I love watching it until this very day. 	1 
When I was a little girl I would have to wear shoes with holes in it to school. Everyone made fun of me all the time. My family could not afford much.	0 
that must have been embarrassing_comma_ I hope you weren't to traumatized	0 
I think it is a good trauma cause to this day it keeps me working hard for my dreams so that I will never have to be in that place again.	0 
that is good to hear_comma_ it was a motivation to succeed_comma_ a great character building 	1 
i was sad to see my favorite tree had been broken in the storm last week	0 
Aw man that sucks. It must have been a crazy storm.	0 
it was pretty bad but i think the tree was already dying	0 
How big was it?	1 
I am very fearful of dying. I know it will come one day_comma_ I just hope and pray it doesn't hurt so bad.	0 
You shouldn't think about death whilst you're alive! Just live each day to the fullest. 	0 
Yes you are right but it is hard to not think about it when there is so much death going on around the world and we have to hear about it through the media.	0 
Yes but death comes to all of us someday. So I think its best we enjoy our life whilst we are blessed with it. 	0 
You are right my friend! Thanks!	1

That's the worst! Because now you'll be freaking out trying to think of the things you may not even remember whether or not could have been there. That must be an anxious feeling. 	0 
It really is_comma_ it just sucks losing all of those things. They were like my connection to the past.	0 
Yeah_comma_ I'm not quite a hoarder or a packrat when it comes to those things_comma_ but I do get sentimental with some physical objects. If I lost them_comma_ I'd feel like it would be an itch I couldn't scratch_comma_ because I couldn't replace what I lost. Hopefully you can work past it somehow.	1 
I am at peace with myself after taking a nice hot shower	0 
Oh man_comma_ thats the best feeling in the world. Getting out of a shower especially if its into clean freshly laundered sheets.	0 
Yes! I feel like a new person!	0 
It's such a wonderful feeling_comma_ I should take a shower soon too.	1

i am so looking forward to the day we pass from this world and go to heaven	0 
Ouch.  Why? 	0 
because  i am a very faithful person and i trust in my god!	0 
Oh I see.  Very interesting that your faith makes you want to die though.	1 
tomorrow is my first university day and i'm very nervous	0 
its not so bad_comma_ it can be intimidating but you just need to figure out the campus layout and classes but its very smooth from there	0 
i hope i won't get lost but i'm so bad with that_comma_ i always get lost. 	0 
once you figure the way it just becomes routine	1 
whenever you feel so hopeless_comma_ so distance and you feel like nothing ever matters_comma_ just remember to trust in the universe_comma_ for it has a plan for you	0 
You are so right_comma_ did you read that somewhere?	0 
no_comma_ i just came up with this philosophy while facing an existential dilemma 	0 
That is cool_comma_ have you studied any philosophy in school?	0 
No_comma_ i study it in my free time	1 
do you ever just feel so grateful that you're alive?	0 
Yes_comma_ I feel that every day.	0 
it's the most amazing feeling ever right? it feels like the universe gives us everything.	0 
I wish people understood how precious life really is.	1 
i threw my laptop the other day and i already regret it	0 
Why did you throw your laptop?	0 
because i was very pissed off_comma_ i wasn't able to work .	0 
Sometimes I lose my temper like that too.	1

i was super late for my meeting on tuesday _comma_ i got so embarrassed 	0 
Oh no_comma_ I hope it wasn't an important meeting.	0 
it was actually_comma_ and because of the traffic i couldn't make it	0 
Sorry to hear that_comma_ were they understanding about it?	1 
my wife has been very sick recently and i am making the soup that is famous with our family recipe and she is slowly getting better	0 
I'm sorry your wife is sick.  What kind of soup is it?	0 
it's called lentil soup and we make it a special way with cumin spice and love 	0 
That sounds quite delicious if I must say.	1 
ever feel so full of emotions when looking at old pictures?	0 
Yeah.  reminds me of the good old days!  	0 
for me it's when you get more than just nostalgia_comma_ when you get sad_comma_ happy and sentimental 	0 
Yeah same here.  I remember one time awhile back I took some pictures of when the aliens landed in my backyard.   That was some good times!	1 
i am just so scared of what is going to happen in the future_comma_ i need to make money_comma_ have a house_comma_ own a car_comma_ and other materialistic good because  i am a person of the 21st century and i cannot afford any of this so i need to get a job_comma_ but all these jobs are paying me next to nothing despite my masters degree in computer science_comma_ what to do?	0 
Yikes_comma_ that's a tough one and I can definitely feel your pain on the job market. I think either network your way to a higher pay job (depends on connections) or possibly go back to school to a doctorate or certain specialist degrees.	0 
ummm? excuse me? do you know people earn a lot from computer science_comma_ it is not my degree for sure_comma_ it's this corrupt world we live in that's the problem	0 
Yes but the market is quite flooded with CS degree holders. It's hard to get something unless you are specialized I think. Unfortunately I don't see society changing any time soon.	1 
life is beautiful isn't it?	0 
Life is the most beautiful thing.	0 
are you happy with the way things are? i am enjoying every second	0 
I live every day like it's my last.	1

Waiting in line is the worst.	0

Sounds like you are pretty confident in yourself!	0 
yup i am !  so so confident and i think this is a good trait to have	0 
I agree that it is as well. In most situations_comma_ it can work to one's benefit.	1 
feelsbadman_comma_ some one in this absurd family ! WHO KEEPS ON TAKING MY BLOODY SHOES! 	0 
I don't understand what you are trying to tell me. Is this a joke?	0 
no_comma_ i am angry! imagine every morning you wake and someone in your family takes your shoes because they want to make you angry	0 
Why would they want to do that?	0 
like i said to  make me angry_comma_ they are selfish and jealous	1 
it sure does bring back a lot of fond memories as you go for a walk past your old neighbourhood 	0 
I can imagine the flood of emotions.	0 
yup_comma_ many memories from the past_comma_ the good_comma_ the bad	0 
I hope it was worth visiting.	1

i don't know how to feel_comma_ i've been working so hard the past few months but i feel like i am not getting anywhere_comma_ still at the same place as i was 	0 
I completely understand. Maybe you need a vacation to recharge the batteries.	0 
maybe_comma_ but i also need a plan because if i continue like this_comma_ i won't get anywhere for reals	0 
Are you looking for a new job?	1 
can i really do everything alone? i just feel so useless	0 
That's not true I'm sure. Do you have any friends to hang out with?	0 
no_comma_ i don't like people_comma_ they make me lose more hope in the plane	0 
I can understand. Maybe connect with some like-minded people online? 	1 
last week my friends and i ordered pizza while at their house_comma_ after an hour of eating the pizza i pucked everywhere on his couch_comma_ i feel so bad and grossed out	0 
ewww that's gross!  Did you help clean it up?  And what was in that pizza anyway??	0 
god knows what was in that pizza_comma_ but i helped clean and the mess was still showing_comma_ but he said it wasn't a problem 	0 
He seems like a good friend.  	1 
... everything seems to be everywhere_comma_ i am just scared out of my mind of the future	0 
The future certainly can be scary.	0 
are you not scared of the future?	0 
I am curious for what the future holds.	1 
my mother got a big cake and left it in the fridge for us to eat later_comma_ i selfishly took it all upstairs and closed my door and ate all of it while watching anime	0 
Oh wow_comma_ the whole cake? Has she found out yet? Was she mad?	0 
she hasn't yet_comma_ we're suppose to have it later tonight_comma_ but how disappointed she'll be when she comes back from work and sees that the cake has been entirely devoured by me... 	0 
If you can and have time_comma_ I'd try to get a quick replacement and explain to her. Maybe she'll understand.	1 
i created this math formula yesterday for uniquely identifying words! and i am so happy with myself	0 
Oh cool.  How does it work?	0 
it seperates the ascii values of each character and adds them up to give a number_comma_ then it divides  them by their length and then it does something else which i will keep a secret :P	0 
Oh that's easy peasy.  Sometimes I only have to wipe once when I go number 2.  	1 
i never got the chance to get promoted at work even though all my colleagues did!	0 
Oh man_comma_ I would be so jealous. When will it be your turn? 	0 
i am envying them. i don't know _comma_ i'm working very hard as well.	0 
I think your boss should give you more recognition in that case!	1 
i care a lot about my family and always want them to be happy	0 
That's good!  You're awesome!  Family is what is important	0 
family should always come first. 	0 
I agree!  	1 
i am very ready for my first semester in university!	0 
ready for all those ice breakers? those amazing crazy party? what are you hoping to do this year?	0 
i am really hoping i can make some good friends_comma_ and just learn about everything i don't know a lot about you know?	0 
yeah defiantly_comma_ my best advice to you is to learn and focus on your studying and always expand in knowledge that's the one thing we seniors always wish we had done   	1 
i was very angry when i learned about what happened	0 
what? what happend? why are you angry?	0 
i'm angry because my mom and my sister had a fight and they aren't talking together. that made me very mad.	0 
really? was it about something very stupid?	1 
I play guitar as a hobby but rarely play in front of other guitarists.  I only feel comfortable doing it if the people around me play worse or not at all.	0 
I think that's a kind of natural reaction_comma_ especially if it is just a hobby. I would have a fear of being judged.	0 
Exactly!  I always feel there's less chance of embarrassment if you're the best in the room.	0 
Definitely. I feel the same speaking foreign languages. It's more of a self-conscious thing.	1 
i'm looking forward to next week_comma_ i'm going on a holiday with my fiance!	0 
that does sound like fun! where do you guys plan on going?	0 
well_comma_ we are going to turkey! i've heard some good things about that country i'm very excited	0 
that sounds like a good time. not the usual country you see people vacation to	1 
i have a lot of hope for the future. i'm going to get married soon_comma_ and everything is going to be amazing!	0 
That's awesome! It's so good that you have such a positive outlook on everything.	0 
isn't it? i don't see negative things in life_comma_ i try to always look at the bright side.	0 
I think you have the perfect outlook. I hope I can strive to maintain something like that as well.	1 
i am sad because my brother failed me.	0 
what did he do yolo?	0 
he couldn't keep his promise with me. he said he was going to get me pepsi max but he didn't and that made me sad.	0 
this is absolutely the worst! he is no man in my eyes!	1 
my brother was sick and he puked in front of me_comma_ it smelled horrible	0 
Oh_comma_ yuck! That's gross. Did you get sick too?	0 
i didn't_comma_ but no one was home and i had to clean that up :(	0 
that's rough! My husband always did with the kids when he was home.	1 
i am moving out of this country soon and i'm worried about my university_comma_ because i'll have a lot of exams to do and not gonna lie i'm stressed out.	0 
don't be! i know this is overused but trust me_comma_ it's not as hard as everyone else makes it to be_comma_ if you focus and aim for your goals_comma_ you will get it! i know you can do it!	0 
that was very needed _comma_ thank you so much_comma_ i was really stressed because of it.	0

It really is_comma_ what can we do to help?	0 
i don't know maybe starting by stop using all those cars ? i don't know i wish we could do something.	0 
That'd be a good idea_comma_ we could all start biking.	1 
i just delivered the best project at work! 	0 
What was the project?1	0 
the project that i worked on was to deliver a marketing speech for healthy eating	0 
You must be an expert on nutrition then!	1

i am travelling soon_comma_ but i am bringing with myself a lithium ion battery for phone replacement to the airport security_comma_ i am anticipating the security there so i may talk to the person at the desk to confirm i can take such an item	0 
yeah. it would be best to check the website for a list of approved items	0 
the website says yes! but my friends say they don't know if that's accurate so i think i need to double check once i am there	0 
yes. hopefully all will go well	1 
i am very happy_comma_ my best friend is getting married today	0 
Are you his best man?	0 
well _comma_ i consider him my brother_comma_ i don't know if he thinks the same_comma_ we grew up together.	0 
I hope he does_comma_ being the best man is an honour and you're ready for it.	1 
at work i ended up writing code that is able to detect words that are similar and detect their meaning and cluster them into groups of n clusters 	0 
sounds quite interesting to code	0 
it sure is! i used genetic algorithm as well as k-means and neural netwroking	0 
oh dang i never really dabbled that deep when i did my small share of programming	1 
i am nervous and scared of my feelings_comma_ i feel like in the future they will hurt me	0 
What happened?	0 
nothing so far_comma_ but it's what migh thappen in the future	0 
I hope all goes well so you're as happy as possible.	1 
i saw one of my old friends today	0 
That's good! I hope you had a good time?	0

so greatful to be given this wonderful life	0 
What are you planning on doing with it?	0 
build a life with my fiance and grow together and gain more and more knowledge 	0 
That sounds so admirable_comma_ I'd love to see you grow to an amazing person.	1 
in my room_comma_ alone and i am starving	0 
why don't you go get yourself some food? or just order some?	0 
i have_comma_ but the wait is so real you know?	0 
oh god i get you! waiting for your food to arrive is real torture.	1 
i saw a cat the other day it showed up out of nowhere i got really scared.	0 
wow_comma_ spooky_comma_ what did you do next?	0 
i just walked past it.	0 
that must have startled you 	1

You having money problems?	0 
yeah! but i still ordered but the food delivery isn't here yet	0 
I don't think I've ever had a delivery guy be that late. I'd be mad.	1 
my cat really got on my nerves today! she pooped in the kitchen floor and that was the first thing i saw when i woke up	0 
Oh_comma_ that stinks...literally! I have pets too so I know how you feel. My cat will eat too much sometimes and throw up!	0 
it's the worst right?... really made me so so so mad	0 
It is_comma_ I wished they could just use the toilet like we do!	1 
i am so proud of my fiancee_comma_ she's been working extra hard.	0 
thats good! nothing wrong with hard work and dedication	0 
and seeing her reaching her goals and growing so much makes me so happy.	0 
that does have to feel really good	1 
I am very lucky that I live out in the country where the quality of life is so much better than living in the high stress cities	0 
Yes_comma_ where do you live?	0 
I live in Colorado with the mountains and fresh air with so many wonderful outdoor activities available.	0 
I love Colorado. I visit all the time.	0 
It is great any time of the year. There are so many cool things to do even in the snowy winters.	1 
Sometimes I feel very happy that I am a US resident. When I travel to other countries everyone is so amazed that I am from the US. They treat you very differently because they think that the US is so great_comma_ rich and free.	0 
Yeah_comma_ we have a lot to be thankful for.  We take for granted many of the perks of being a US resident!	0 
That is for sure! I just wish other countries were the same. There are so many people suffering all over the world.	0 
I agree. There is a lot of suffering.  I am glad people like you and I recognize that.	1 
I am very happy that my popsicle business is finally thriving! I have worked so hard on it for many years.	0 
That is great. Where are you selling your popsicle?	0 
From my house and from a few local stores. I am not ready to make it any bigger than that.	0 
I understand. Good luck.	1 
I was so happy to come home the other day and everything was clean and dinner was already on the table. What did I do to deserve that?	0 
You were probably just being you.	0 
No_comma_ I think somebody wants something... I am just waiting to hear it_comma_ lol.	0 
Haha! That's usually the case. : )	1 
I lived in New York City for a couple of years and it is definitely a place where one can feel quite alone if you don't have family or friends.	0 
I understand. Is your family living far from New York?	0 
Yes_comma_ a plane ride away. But there was also a lot of cool things to see. I think it was a good experience but it would be better with friends and family.	0 
It is always cool to have family and friends close by.	1 
When I am in nature I feel good that this world is exactly as it should be. Everything is moving along to Gods plans.	0 
That is a great mindset to have!  You must feel very happy and content!	0 
Yes_comma_ when I am in nature. :) But when I come to the big cities I feel like it is the devils playgrounds	0 
Why do cities make you feel that way?	0 
Because they are filled with concrete and pollution and unhappy people.	1 
 feel so bad_comma_ I forgot again to fill the gas tank up in the car after I used it all. My friend is going to kill me!	0 
Oh no.. and no one really likes pumping gas. 	0 
I just seem to forget until I get home. Oh well I will just have to give her some money again instead. Oh she is going to be angry.	0 
You could grab it when shes done with it and fill it up real quick for her! 	0 
Nah_comma_ I will just give her the money and endure the pain. Haha	1 
just got back from grocery shopping_comma_ The cashier gave me back $10 more change than I supposed to get	0 
Did you give it back or just walk away?	0 
i did not find out untill i got home_comma_ the store is kind of far and I think I'm going to keep it_comma_ but it's eating on my conscious because of that	0 
Yeah_comma_ that is a hard one to deal with.  Maybe you should give it back so you will not feel bad about yourself.	1 
I feel a little weird about looking at this house for sale. It looks haunted and I think something bad happened there_comma_ but not sure.	0 
I would ask the realtor on some background and even google the address to see if any abuse headlines come from that place. 	0 
That is a good idea. It is such good deal and I think it would not need much money to fix it up. But a ghost in the house is definitely a deal breaker!	0 
Kinda makes you think even more since its such a good deal that people are just like get rid of it - deff look into it! 	1 
When bad things happen I get too emotional. I think more than other do. Sometimes I think I am crazy.	0 
I'm sorry to hear that...sometime you just have stop and take a deep breathe so you don't get overwhelmed.	0 
Yeah_comma_ I know. But in the moment it is hard. I guess I am just a very emotional person. Maybe I need theraoy_comma_ lol.	0 
Therapy is a good thing. Its is nothing to be ashamed of.	1 
I have faith that I will get pregnant soon. Why is it so hard? Isn't that what a women's body is built to do?	0 
Maybe it isnt your body_comma_ but also your partners! Something to check into to see which end its coming from_comma_ but none the less it will happen! 	0 
Yeah_comma_ more people are having these issues these days. I think it may be true that someone may be poisoning us through the water and food or something! It is a scary world!	0 
It's hard to trust anything_comma_ even the oatmeal recently was put on the news that its high in cancer causing pest spray. 	1 
I found a lost baby duck. The mother was no where to be found. I brought it home and took care of it until it was big enough to be let loose again.	0 
Thats kind of you_comma_ did everything go well when you put it back into the wild? 	0 
The duck flew away and was never to be found again. Hopefully he was reunited somehow with his family. I just hope so.	0 
Sounds like it went well! 	1 
I feel so upset when other people tell such horrible lies about other people. Some people are just cruel and are only out for themselves.	0 
Yes_comma_ I hate those kind of people. They have nothing to do expect lying about other people.	0 
Yeah_comma_ it is very hurtful. But what can one do? Get back at them? It just seems like you would go to their level. I guess it is better to just swallow it and move on.	0 
I just ignore them. At some point_comma_ they stop but they understand that it is not working.	1 
This past week my 3 year old son caught strep throat. I ended up having to miss the entire week at work to stay home with him.	0 
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he is feeling better. 	0 
He is_comma_ i hated missing work_comma_ but that the sort of thing a person has to do for their children.	0 
It is. Taking care of sick child is hard. Missing work is also hard. The things we have to do for our children.	1 
My high heel broke in the cement the other morning and I had to wear them all day at work. Not a good day!	0 
Sounds like something on a movie! What a work day right_comma_ my god. Bring extras next time? lol 	0 
Yeah_comma_ from now on I will have an extra pair in my desk. Everyone was teasing me all day. It was so annoying!	0 
I bet they were lol atleast you can laugh about it now. 	1 
My father continuously gambles all his earnings away even though he has two minors to support.	0 
That's very sad_comma_ has he considered getting help for his addiction?	0 
Nope_comma_ he doesn't care and denies it's an issue. When I found out_comma_ I was too angry to look at him.	0 
I can certainly understand your feelings_comma_ I hope he can somehow fix his habits.	1 
My friends and I started playing Halo online recently.	0 
Has it been a lot of fun?	0 
Incredibly so. It brought back so many great memories from the times we played on the Xbox 360.	0 
Oh yeah I remember those old Halo days too during my childhood_comma_ such a great game.	1 
I feel happy to just stay in and watch a movie at home on a Saturday night. I have no desire to go out and party like most people I know do.	0 
I understand that feeling. It wouldn't make sense for us all to want to do the same things_comma_ especially if you've partied before already.	0 
Yeah_comma_ been there done that. I don't miss those hangovers on Sunday morning. Totally not worth it anymore.	0 
That's cool that you know what you want from life right now and that you don't feel obligated to do things just because of norms.	1 
Last month_comma_finally_comma_ after years of working towards it_comma_ I was finally promoted into senior management at my job.	0 
Oh that's great! Does it come with a nice raise?	0 
Yes it did_comma_ and much better benefits. Seems like I finally got to the end of a very long road.	0 
Do you kind of feel like there's no where else to go?	1 
After working for years at a job I didn't like_comma_ and struggling in school_comma_ I found a new job that coincides with my Major.	0 
I am so happy for you! All of your hard work paid off!	0 
Thanks! For the first time in a long time_comma_ the future isn't looking so dark.	0 
That is great accomplishment! I wish you well on your new path in life!	1 
Last week at work_comma_ I went to sit down at my desk chair and completely missed it and fell straight into the floor.	0 
Oh my...I hope you didn't hurt yourself.	0 
Just my pride. My boss and a couple coworkers got a good view of me just flopping into the floor as documents and paperwork went flying.	0 
Since you didn't hurt yourself I think I will have to laugh. It sounds like it was funny.	1 
I know I should not feel like this but I feel so envious when I drive through the rich neighborhoods and I know that I will never be able to live there.	0 
Yea_comma_ I feel the same way.  It's worse when you have to pass by them twice a day.	0 
I have to pass twice a day too. Oh well_comma_ I should just be grateful for what I have now. I just can't help that feeling from creeping in though. Maybe I will buy a lottery ticket_comma_ lol.	0 
Heck no.  Be envious that they were lucky enough to have their parents hand down all their money to them.	1 
Last month my wife and I ordered our first new car with a delivery time of six weeks. 	0 
Oooh_comma_ how exciting!! What kind of car did you get?	0 
We ordered a new Ford Superduty pickup. This six weeks is taking forever.	0 
I'll bet it is! Best of luck with your new truck!	1 
In the 6th grade_comma_ a bird pooped on my back during lunchtime.	0 
Indoors?	0 
Nah we were having a barbecue outdoors. 	0 
In the 6th grade? Where is this school?	0 
In Quebec. All schools have a budget for extra-curricular activities and events. We had a barbecue once every year in June with free food.	0 
Makes sense. I live in the states. We have no money for such things.	0 
That sounds awful_comma_ all schools need a budget for activities for the students. Anyways I had no replacement shirt and I had to rinse it out and wear it for the rest of the day; I felt sick.	0 
How big a bird was this. I dont remember anything from the 6th grade.	1 
Last month_comma_ a buddy of mine bought a scratch off ticket and won $4500. I never win anything when I buy them.	0 
Wow!! That's crazy. I'm like that though. I never win anything either	0 
I mean I am happy for him and all_comma_ but I wouldn't mind some found money either.	0 
haha right! Maybe you should buy a few and see what happens. You cant win if you don't play	1 
Our puppy wiggled out of his leash. He ran toward the busy road and was hit by a car. It was awful	0 
Oh god_comma_ I am so sorry. Is he okay now?	0 
Sadly_comma_ no. He passed away at the vet a few hours later.	0 
I hate to hear that. It is so hard to lose a pet. I hope you are doing okay through this.	1 
coincidence_comma_ I too I'm taking a trip but a business one_comma_ I 'm not looking forward to flying	0 
Do you not fly often? It isnt too bad.	0 
a couple of time_comma_ but it truly scares me	0 
Well if it is a bigger plane it isnt as bad. Just bring some headphones and listen to some comforting music.	1 
The other day I forgot to take my anti-anxiety medication.	0 
You have to be more careful next time_comma_ maybe you need a calendar to remind you.	0 
I put an alarm on my phone_comma_ I just get so busy some mornings. At least it didn't affect me too bad until the next morning.	0 
I am so sorry to hear_comma_ I am glad that it didn't cause a lasting effect.	1 
I am feeling pretty good after my interview for a promotion at work last week. My boss told me I nailed the interview.	0 
That is a fantastic feeling. I hope you get it.	0 
Well I have almost twice the experience as the other two candidates_comma_ so I have a really good feeling about it.	0 
Keep riding that confidence. It will get you places. It sounds like you deserve it.	1 
The other night_comma_ drunk bicyclists were following me home and laughing on the sidewalk.	0 
That must have been a bit scary_comma_ You should have called the police.	0 
I wasn't too far from my home so I figured I could tough it out. I was pretty scared however_comma_ especially since it was nighttime. 	0 
You cannot be too careful these days_comma_ i am so sorry that happened to you.	1 
NASA released some free space posters a couple of months back.	0 
Okay! Now that is interested_comma_ I would love to see them.	0 
I think they have them up on their website_comma_ you should give them a look! I had them printed for a small fee and now they're up on my wall!	0 
Oh really? I will be checking it out. I would love to have some.	0 
Yup. The poster files are free_comma_ you just have to get them printed somewhere. They have a few different themes. I got Europa_comma_ Trappist-1e_comma_ Mars Explorers Wanted and "We Need You"	0 
Free? That makes it even better_comma_ I will be getting me some posters.	0 
Sweet! I hope you like them as much as I do!	0 
I hope so too. Thank you so much!	1 
Yesterday I found a massive spider in my room.	0 
I am afraid of spiders. I would run and scream. What happened afterwards?	0 
It ran off somewhere and I couldn't find it_comma_ even though I moved most of my furniture. I'm a little scared.	0 
I would move out of that room. Maybe you need to spray the area.	1 
There was a chance that it could rain on the day my best friends and I went camping.	0 
Oh no! Did it end up raining? Did you take rain gear?	0 
It barely did at night_comma_ but for the few days we went camping it was nice weather! I'm so thankful that it didn't_comma_ because we made a lot of nice memories during our trip.	0 
That sounds like it was a lot of fun!	1 
looks like we have something in common_comma_ when i walk through my house_comma_ the rooms are empty. There are no one here but me	0 
Im sorry to hear that it can be hard ;/	0 
i know_comma_ i am trying to cope but the emptiness is unbearable	0 
Yeah i would get a pet	1 
I was watching over my girlfriend's cat while she went away on a little trip.	0 
That is so sweet of you. I love cats_comma_ you must be a caring spouse.	0 
I like to think so_comma_ thanks! Unfortunately_comma_ the cat wanted barely anything to do with me and I felt so isolated.	0 
The cat didn't like you_comma_ oh dear. I am so sorry that happened. You need to spend more time with the cat.	1 
 Ever since I started taking medication for anxiety and depression_comma_ I've been gaining weight. 	0 
I have heard that is a common side effect but you might want to talk to your doctor about it	0 
I have_comma_ she said I'm okay because I still have a healthy weight. I've been a skinny boy all my life_comma_ and I still am but this extra chub has me feeling down.	0 
Well you could always work out and turn it into muscle	1 
 No matter who comes to the door_comma_ my dog barks.	0 
Its a good guard dog then	0 
In a way yes_comma_ but not really. As soon as anyone ENTERS the house_comma_ he turns into a huge lovable pup and wants them to pet him. He's such a nuisance but I love him.	0 
What kind of dog is he	0 
A Brittany Spaniel.	1 
I was driving down the highway when I saw a car in an accident. It seems they hit a cow! Oh my!	0 
Animal accidents can be really bad!	0 
I felt so bad for the poor cow. It seems no one was hurt except the cow. :( The car was pretty damaged though.	0 
At least no one else was injured_comma_ but it is sad about the cow. 	1 
my pet dog is getting older. I know one day she won't be around anymore	0 
Just cherish the moments	0 
I will_comma_ but just the thought of it makes me blue	0 
It will be okay	1 
I put in a lot of effort and energy and I found a new job!	0 
What kind of job is it	0 
It's an online teaching position and I feel so good about myself. 	0 
That is a nice job I am sure	1 
I came home drunk from the bar and stole my neighbor's package that was sitting out.	0 
Uh oh! Did you get in trouble?	0 
No_comma_ but I felt like a jerk when I gave it to them the next day and had to explain what happened.	0 
That is good that you gave it back and were able to admit your mistake. I am sure they appreciate that.	1 
With all the money I've been saving up_comma_ I should be able to purchase an Oculus Rift Virtual Reality system soon!	0 
Awesome_comma_ congrats! I'm not too familiar with the Oculus Rift_comma_ is there a particular game you're eager to play?	0 
Hmm maybe Robo Recall_comma_ a game about fighting robots. Otherwise I have to find out what games are available!	0 
Robot games are always fun. I bet you'll have a great time!	1 
I went on a new bike trail the other day_comma_ it was super fun but also a little scary.	0 
Ooh how so? Were there a lot of hills and sharp turns?	0 
Yep_comma_ exactly. I also have a new bike so between the new route and the new bike_comma_ I was totally terrified of wiping out. So I took it slow.	0 
I see. Do you think you'll be going back on that bike trail?	0 
Absolutely! And now that I know it better_comma_ I won't be so scared. I'm heading back out there Tuesday_comma_ can't wait!	0 
I hope you have tons of fun and enjoy a safe trip!	1 
I made a new friend at a convention I was volunteering at. I was shocked.	0 
What kind of con was it	0 
Otakuthon 2018. It's about anime_comma_ Japanese culture and videogames. I was volunteering for the MSI booth (a PC-Gaming company).	0 
that is really cool! I like in Texas so i cant go to stuff like that	0 
That's a shame. Anyways_comma_ I haven't made any friends in well over a year because I'm awful in social situations.	1 
I participated in a ropes course with my colleagues_comma_ we had to learn how to trust each other.	0 
That sounds amazing!  How did everyone do?	0 
Pretty good. The hardest part for most of us was the blind trust fall_comma_ but in the end most of us learned to put faith in each other.	0 
Awesome!  Hopefully what you guys learned in the ropes course translates over into the workplace.	1 
I let my little sister go into my wallet and grab my credit card so she can order something online for herself.	0 
Why did you do tht?	0 
She's very trustworthy and I knew she wouldn't steal from me. It was also something she needed and didn't have the money to get it yet.	0 
That makes sense_comma_ you are a good older sibling!	0 
Thanks for the compliment! But she's also a great younger sibling!	1 
 I once drank six pints of beer in a night and ended up getting very sick.	0 
I would imagine_comma_ that is a lot to drink!	0 
It really is. I felt so bad about my actions_comma_ but it hasn't stopped me from doing it at least one other time.	0 
I get that_comma_ well I hope you feel betternow!	1 
I never learned how to ride a bike.	0 
why is that?	0 
My parents never saw the importance I guess. 	0 
I get that_comma_ did your friends know how to ride bikes?	0 
They did_comma_ but I was always too scared and not confident enough in myself. I thought I would fall and really hurt myself.	0 
Well it is never hard to learn if you give it a shot	1 
My girlfriend made the cutest and most touching card for my birthday.	0 
Aww that's sweet. Did you cry?	0 
I almost did. It was hard holding the tears back.	0 
Why hold them back? It okay to cry lol	1 
My cat has terminal kidney failure. There's no cure.	0 
Oh_comma_ I am so sorry! I used to have a dog we loved so much who had diabetes...we gave him insulin shots twice a day but we lost him. I can relate to how you feel... 	0 
It really sucks. It's fairly common in cats and I sort of knew the diagnosis was coming but that doesn't make it any easier. I'm sorry to hear about your dog.	0 
Our pets are our family...it's not easy to see them suffer..I feel for you. And thank you about our dog.	1 
I received horrific news from a best friend recently.	0 
Oh no_comma_  what happened?	0 
They had tried to commit suicide. It was very hard to hear but thankfully they are getting the help they need.	0 
That is terrible_comma_ you must have been devastated_comma_  I hope he find the help he/she needs.	1 
you know at work_comma_ one of my coworker is always singing to himself_comma_ it bugs me	0 
Oh dear_comma_ but are you allowed to sing at work? That must be so annoying.	0 
it really is_comma_ he thinks he knows how to sing_comma_ i would not be so annoying if he knew how to sing 	0 
He needs to just sing in the shower. Tell him to quit singing.	1 
One time I slipped on a banana peel	0 
Haha no way_comma_ I thought that only happens in cartoons!	0 
Yep_comma_ everyone was laughing at me	0 
I'm sorry but I probably would have_comma_ too. Hopefully you didn't get hurt though!	1 
My neighbor was recently diagnosed with a pretty bad form of cancer.	0 
That is unfortunate_comma_ is he doing any chemotherapy ?	0 
I'm not entirely sure of the regimen_comma_ I didn't want to ask too many questions. But I've been bringing pre-cooked meals over for her and her husband when I get a chance to help them out a little.	0 
Well I hope everything works out for him!	1 
One time I was waiting all day for the mail man to deliver my package	0 
What were you waiting for!	0 
I was waiting for my computer monitor!	0 
Nice!  The anticipation must have been killing you!	1 
I ran out of laundry soap the other day_comma_ when I went to the store I grabbed a brand I hadn't used in many years.	0 
How well did it work out for you?	0 
Oh it worked fine_comma_ but when I pulled my laundry out it surprised me how the smell of that soap reminded me of my life all those years ago when I used it regularly. Isn't it weird how scents can do that?	0 
Wow!  That is such a great feeling!  I love when good memories come back to me!	0 
Right? I didn't expect that could happen with laundry soap!	1 
One time I saw my husband looking at another women	0 
o no what did you do?	0 
I slapped him and beat up the other women	0 
o no im not sure that was the best response	1 
I was leaving the bar the other day with my boyfriend and tripped on the step just outside the door.	0 
Oh No! Did you get hurt?	0 
Well_comma_ physically not so much_comma_ just a light scrape on my knee. But man my pride got wounded bad!	0 
I bet that was a little embarrassing. 	1 
I was a cigarette smoker for nearly an entire decade. In retrospect this is slightly embarrassing. 	0 
Don't be embarrassed. You know that you had a problem and you are better now for it	0 
Right. Not much that can be done about it now. I enjoy having more money now though for sure!	0 
That's understandable. I wish you the best in staying smoke free!	1 
Being a parent so far has not been anywhere near as difficult as I expected it to be. My daughter is awesome!	0 
That is great to hear that things are going well for you.	0 
Thanks that means a lot to me!	0 
I am sure that things will continue to go smooth since you have a positive attitude about it.	1 
I was waiting to hear back about a potential job offer_comma_ I really wanted the job.	0 
How long has it been since the interview?	0 
That's the thing_comma_ my anxiety and excitement started the moment I first talked to the company_comma_ it was driving me crazy. But I ended up getting the job!	0 
Oh well congrats and good job!	1 
My friend just won $500 in scratch-off lottery tickets!	0 
Oh that is awesome for your friend!	0 
Oh totally. I'm happy for her but part of me was also a little envious_comma_ I hate to admit.	0 
Yeah I can understand that. I would feel the same.	0 
Well good_comma_ I don't feel so bad about it then. I thought I was being a bad friend!	1 
I took on a challenging speed bike course recently that was above my skill level.	0 
That was probably not a good idea_comma_ how did it go for you?	0 
It actually worked out amazing! I knew going into it that I'd practiced a lot and had built up my skills_comma_ so I was sure I could do it even if I was a little hesitant.	0 
Well_comma_ you never know if you can do something till you try. I am glad you were able to do so well.	1 
When I was interviewing for a promotion at my job. I did all I could to get ready for the interview. 	0 
That can be kind of scary. How did it go?	0 
It went great. I having put in all the work ahead of time to get ready_comma_ I knew exactly how to answer the questions they had for me. 	0 
Awesome_comma_ congratulations! It just goes to show how great things can happen when you're prepared.	1 
At my job a coworker took credit for a job I had completed. Once I found out_comma_ I went straight to my boss and got it straightened out.	0 
Good job.  Your coworker sounds like a shady little b**ch did you let him/her know what's up	0 
I found them and gave them a piece of my mind. What kind of person does something like that.	0 
For real.  Glad you had enough self-respect to handle it_comma_ most people dont'	1 
We went camping this summer and my boyfriend made fun of me for packing so much stuff.	0 
Aww haha how many bags did you bring	0 
It honestly wasn't *that* much stuff_comma_ I packed it well. But the joke's on him_comma_ he felt dumb for making fun of me after we needed a bottle opener and I just so happened to pack one.	0 
Heey there you go...sounds like you're the resourceful one	1 
This couple just moved into my building and have been having loud parties almost every night!	0 
That sounds awful!	0 
Yeah_comma_ it's really irritating. I don't mind people having fun but come on_comma_ every single night? It's really ticking me off.	0 
Have you tried talking to them about it?	0 
Yes_comma_ I casually mentioned condo rules on noise and asked them to at least try and keep it down on weekdays.	1 
An actual ice cream man came through my neighborhood! I didn't think they still exist.	0 
I don't think that I have seen/heard one of those since the 90s... Possibly the early 2000's at the earliest! Crazy_comma_ I didn't know that they still exist either!	0 
Right? Seeing the kids come running out really made me miss when I was little and got all excited about the ice cream man!	0 
I loved that too!	1 
I am content with my life. I have nothing to complain about_comma_ luckily!	0 
That is wonderful to hear_comma_ good for you. There's way too much craziness in the world making people unhappy. It's nice to hear someone is doing well and happy.	0 
Agreed. I have to actively distance myself away from the drama of reality but doing this makes me happier. Not sure if this is ideal but that's ok!	0 
Distancing yourself from the negative things sounds like a totally healthy way to insulate yourself from that stuff.	1 
I was cleaning out the attic last week_comma_ and came across a box of old photo albums and some of my childhood things. I sat for hours just looking at old photos.	0 
Aw_comma_ that must have brought up a lot of nostalgia for you. 	0 
It really did. Seeing all those old faces I haven't seen for years. It was a great experience.	0 
Did you share it with anyone else?	1 
I recently applied for a job with a  new company. It would be such a step up for my family if I got it.	0 
Nice_comma_ a step up is always such a relief. Do you feel confident you'll get the job?	0 
Some_comma_ I did well in the interview. Just trying to keep spirits up while they make their decision.	0 
Well I hope you get it. Good luck!	1 
I'm waiting to hear about a lucrative job opportunity_comma_ it would pretty much be my dream job.	0 
That's great. How long are you going to have to wait?	0 
Not sure_comma_ hopefully I hear this upcoming week. I feel pretty good about my chances so that's making the waiting a little easier.	0 
I am glad you are so confident about your prospects. I hope you hear something very soon from them.	1 
Most of the decisions that I made as a teenager were kind of embarrassing in retrospect.	0 
I think we've all been there...I've done my fair share of dumbassery	0 
I feel it. Most of the bad decisions were fun_comma_ at least.	0 
Ha YOLOOO	1 
I can't wait until all the trees change colors and the weather starts getting cold. I love Autumn!	0 
I know right! I noticed leaves on the ground the other day and got all excited! Is autumn your favorite season_comma_ too?	0 
Yes! My absolute favorite! It's not too cold and not too hot and there is so much beauty all around! It is soon time to get all the winter clothes out.	0 
I don't mind winter either but you're so right_comma_ the temperature is just right during fall.	1 
I worked really hard on this project for work and it totally bombed.	0 
Awe_comma_ sorry to hear that. I am sure you did better than you think.	0 
Well_comma_ not really according to analytics. I was really let down by the fact that it was a flop but I'm not going to let it drag me down too much.	0 
That is a good attitude. Better luck next time!	1 
The house is all cleaned and ready for my guests. Wow_comma_ I was cleaning all day!	0 
I was doing the same thing!  Hard work but so satisfying when you see the results!  Who is coming to stay?	0 
Yes_comma_ there is no better satisfaction_comma_ in my opinion_comma_ than a clean house. :) My sister is visiting with her kids. They are staying for a week here at my house. I am sure the house is going to be trashed in the end.	0 
I completely agree.  Mine can get trashed in 10 minutes flat from the kids.  ha ha. Oh_comma_ how fun!  I hope you have a wonderful time!  Yeah_comma_ you'll probably be cleaning all over again by the end of it but its worth it.	1 
My neighbor sits out on his balcony butt naked sometimes.	0 
That sounds pretty disturbing.  Have you called the cops?	0 
No but that might be a good idea. It's just an awkward and gross situation.	0 
I bet.  I wonder what he is thinking.	1 
I have fixed up house to the best of my ability. I feel very certain that it will sell very quickly.	0 
I certainly hope so_comma_  Why do you want to move?	0 
I am moving to a smaller house with a big yard where life will be a lot easier. Less house to clean and more time outside. :)	0 
That sounds great_comma_ That is how I like my houses to be too.	1 
I feel confident that eating a fruitarian diet will give me more energy and happiness.	0 
Hmm_comma_ don't you need fat and protein in your diet also?	0 
I have done a lot of research and so many fruitarians are thriving and feeling the best they ever had in their life. There is fat in avocados and avocados are considered a fruit..	0 
Oh I hadn't even thought of avocado. Well good luck with the diet_comma_ I hope it works for you!	1 
I wrote an email to a family member I haven't spoken to in a long time and I wasn't sure how they'd take everything I said in it.	0 
Oh wow! That is a brave thing to do! Your letter must have been a little intense if you are worried how they will take it. How did it work out?	0 
Yep_comma_ it was full of emotion and a lot of things I needed to get off my chest. I was quite nervous waiting for a response but it turns out I had nothing to worry about. She was really glad I spoke up!	0 
Awe that is great! I am glad there was a happy ending!	1 
I get so mad when the local kids throw eggs at the front doors of houses in my neighborhood. It is so infuriating!	0 
Oh man I'd be mad too...you should wait outside with a paintball gun 	0 
Yeah! I wish I had the time for it! I am going to buy one of the web cams and catch them in the act. I am going to teach them a lesson! But I love the paintball idea! That is great! 	0 
Yup gotta lay down the law	1 
I moved into this new house and was woken up with this horrible screeching noise in the middle of the night.	0 
Terrifying! What was it?	0 
It turned out to be the sump pump_comma_ I guess it was old. But yes_comma_ it scared the daylights out of me!	0 
Oh good. I bet!  I wouldn't have been able to go back to sleep after that!  Do you have to replace the pump?	0 
I did_comma_ yeah. It was actually still in working condition but I couldn't stand the sound and I'm a light sleeper. No more scary noises at 3am!	1 
I made a really inappropriate joke about a coworker to some other people I work with and it got back to him.	0 
Oops. I hate when that happens. Did they say anything to you?	0 
No_comma_ but the person who told him confessed. So I decided to be the bigger person and apologize to my coworker before things got too out of hand. He actually wasn't that upset and appreciated that I owned up to it_comma_ but I still felt bad for it_comma_ mostly that I did it behind his back.	0 
That was really nice of you to apologize like that. Some people would have just ignored it. I know that could have been embarrassing.	1 
I got my work done early on Friday so I got to spend the day trying out a new bike trail on my new bike!	0 
that sounds exciting! Do you bike a lot?	0 
I've only recently started getting really into it. It sounds kind of corny but getting out there on my bike makes life just really... satisfying. Calm.	0 
Doesn't sound corny. We all need a hobby to relieve stress!	1 
I miss being able to take my children to the park.	0 
How come you can't take them anymore?	0 
they are all grown up. 	0 
Awww_comma_ well maybe you'll have grandchildren that you can take one day!	1 
I studied all night for my final exam"	0 
That's intense. I hope you did well!	0 
I did! I got an A and I am so proud and happy !	0 
Congratulations! That's great news. Well deserved	1 
the neighbor's dog barked all night and kept me up_comma_ let's say I am not very happy right now	0 
I totally understand. The same thing happened to me last week. I thought I was going to lose it!	0 
i understand the dog is being a dog_comma_ but the owner does nothing about it even when i tell him about it	0 
Right_comma_ I had to end up calling the homeowners association on them	1 
My cat somehow figured out how to open the cabinet and stole a bag of treats.	0 
Wow that is very clever. I would have never thought that could happen.	0 
Right? I wasn't even mad about it_comma_ I was astounded by his ingenuity.	0 
That is incredible. I wonder what else you can train him to do.	0 
Well he also taught himself how to use a toilet so who knows!	1 
I feel like my husband is the sweetest man in the world	0 
That is great! Hopefully he continues to be	0 
I think he will. He puts up with me_comma_ and sometimes i can be a pill!	0 
Lol i'm sure you have to put up with him as well so its even	1 
I was so upset when I had to put my dog down last month	0 
Oh no. That's so sad. Was she sick for long?	0 
Not really. She was old and we woke up one day and she could not use her back legs. It was very sad.	0 
I'm sorry. At least she had a good long life.	1 
During my first year in grad school_comma_ my basement apartment flooded. EVERYTHING was destroyed and I had to start over fresh.	0 
That is awful! Did you have insurance to cover everything?	0 
Thankfully_comma_ yes!! It took several months to replace everything that I could -- but even things_comma_ so many things I just simply couldn't replace. 	0 
Yeah that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you. 	1 
I am in charge of booking meeting rooms for outside companies at my job. Last week_comma_ I made a big mistake and accidentally gave a group a room for free when they should've paid $100.	0 
Oh no! I hope you didn't get into too much trouble by doing so!	0 
Thankfully_comma_ not too much! I was simply mortified because this was one of my main responsibilities and I managed to mess that one up so badly!	0 
To be fair_comma_ everybody makes mistakes and it's bound to happen even to the best of us!	1 
My brother and his friends invited me to a party tonight.	0 
Sounds like that could be fun if you like your brother and if you like parties. Do you want to go?	0 
I just came back from it! I'm actually still a little intoxicated. I must say it was a lot of fun_comma_ we celebrated my birthday and I felt very loved and happy.	0 
Happy Birthday! I'm glad you were able to have fun and be surrounded by those that love you.	0 
Thank you so very much! I appreciate the sentiment.	1 
I drank a lot and told my girlfriend that I would definitely sleep with her best friend if she was down to do so.	0 
What was her reaction to that	0 
She was a little sad and surprised_comma_ but we had been talking about threesomes for a long time now so she understood. Regardless_comma_ I felt very ashamed the next day.	0 
I am sure she will forgive you	0 
She already has. We both think of these type of things so all is good.	1 
My husband and I have been watching TV together each night--once the baby is asleep_comma_ of course.	0 
That sounds like some nice relaxing quality time	0 
It really is! it's the only time in the day that we're guaranteed to have some time together_comma_ just us. 	0 
Have you ever passed out together watching tv?	0 
Not yet - but I'm sure it'll happen at some point!	0 
How old is your baby?	0 
8 months old - but by looking at him_comma_ you'd think he was a two-year-old. Thanks for asking!	0 
And how long have you been married?	1 
My wife and I found the perfect house for sale and we excited to put a bid in on it.	0 
that is exciting! will it be your first house?	0 
Well it would have been_comma_ but someone got a bid in before us and it ended up being sold. My wife was so sad.	0 
that is no good! hopefully yall will find a better one	1 
I let my friend watch my dog last weekend.	0 
You must really trust your friend! How did that turn out?	0 
It was good_comma_ he (the dog) seemed really happy when I got back. He said that he let my dog out a bunch and even took him to the park!	0 
Good to hear that it went so well. Do you think you'll let your friend watch him again?	0 
Absolutely. He has proved himself to be trustworthy when it comes to important stuff.	1 
I once almost ruined my husband's master's thesis presentation--something he needed to pass to get his degree.	0 
Oh no_comma_ what did you do?	0 
I started coughing--badly. He and everyone else stopped to look at me and make sure I was okay. He was so distracted after that!	0 
Don't worry_comma_ from what you said it doesn't sound like you almost ruined it. It wasn't something on purpose at least.	1 
I was expecting a surprise birthday party today.	0 
Lol that makes a lot of sense?	0 
Yeah I had a few hints. My expectations were somewhat true; my brother's friend celebrated not only my birthday party_comma_ but two other birthdays today. It was wonderful!	0 
well that sounds fun!	0 
It really was. I was so happy!	1 
Last week while my wife were out for dinner at a restaurant_comma_ I got up to use the restroom and walked by the kitchen. I saw a cook pick up a piece of chicken off the floor and put it back on someone's plate.	0 
Haha caught red handed!	0 
We proceeded to leave the restaurant_comma_ but not after informing the manager_comma_ very loudly_comma_ about the incident. 	0 
Yeah_comma_ I wonder what their bathrooms are like if that's their service	1 
I hope I do well when I start school soon_comma_ I can't help but think it will be too hard.	0 
Don't worry about it you will do fine. Kindergarten isn't too hard. Just don't eat the glue.	0 
Lmao. It's actually my junior year of mech engineering.	0 
Oh I see. My mistake. I was wondering how you could type and spell so well for a 6 year old. Well good luck in college!	0 
Thanks lol. I wish I could type this well at 6 years old.	1 
My husband's been searching for a professional job but can't seem to land one after interviewing.	0 
Did he try to get another diploma in this profession area?	0 
Well_comma_ he has a masters degree and graduate certificate already. He's had a fourth interview for a position last Thursday -- so we are hoping this one will finally be the one!	0 
That is a good news. I hope he get it.	1 
Last month my son had to have surgery to have his tonsils removed.	0 
Surgery on my kids always scares me but I have heard that it is best to have them taken out while they are young	0 
Yeah_comma_ I was terrified. I just wandering around the waiting room the entire time till they came and told me everything went fine. Seemed like it took days.	0 
I understand_comma_ when it comes to our kids and being worried about them it feels like time stand still	1 
Isn't it nice when people bring you food_comma_ when you've had a long day?	0 
Oh for sure. I hate having to cook and do dishes after a long hard day	0 
Exactly! My boyfriend brought me dinner the other night. I had no groceries and just didn't feel like going out after a long stressful day. I was so thankful.	0 
Were at work today or doing something else?	1 
My little sister has been going all across the country this summer_comma_ spending lots of time on money on pop concert after pop concert.	0 
Interesting. How do you feel about it? Do you find it fun and interesting_comma_ or wish she were more responsible with her money?	0 
Mostly I'm a bit frustrated that she's got so much money to blow on these concerts! And to travel all across the country!	0 
Yeah_comma_ I can understand that. Sometimes when you're not in a position to enjoy yourself because you're busy being tied down with responsibilities_comma_ it's easy to get mad at others. Whatever you can do to spin it positively_comma_ I would suggest that. Being negative about it will only make everyone's lives worse.	1 
During this past spring during a bad storm_comma_ we had a tornado touch down in my neighbors yard.	0 
Oh my gosh!  That had to be super scary!	0 
It sounded like a train going by the house from the basement. Thankfully no one was hurt.	0

I don't like joining it when people talk about someone that's not there_comma_ just like what happened yesterday.	0 
Yep I thinks its disrespectful and petty. What happened? 	0 
He was talking about my other friend who is a bit annoying sometimes. While I may agree I just don't like talking behind someones back.	0 
Thats good. I am amazed by people who think its okay to do that. 	0 
Yeah I feel like not everyone is as moral as me. But that's pretentious which is ironically amoral.	1 
I work at a library cataloging materials and am often asked to help my coworkers--it makes me feel like an expert_comma_ though I'm not.	0

They seem to. Or_comma_ at least_comma_ they know whom is the right person to go to for those specific kinds of questions!	0 
Or that as well ha	1 
When I was a young kid_comma_ I stole some comic books from the local grocery store.	0 
Did you ever get caught?	0 
My mother found out and made me walk them back into the store and give them to the manager. That was a humbling experience.	0 
Was she disappointed?	1 
When I went into labor with my son_comma_ it was quite the ordeal. He came before he was supposed to.	0 
How many month earlier he came?	0 
It was actually only a week--but he wasn't showing signs of being physically ready was the problem. Thankfully_comma_ I'd already had my bags packed for weeks so we went to the hospital ready!	0
